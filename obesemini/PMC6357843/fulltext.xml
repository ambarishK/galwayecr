Newly emerging nationally-representative data show recent increases in obesity prevalence in this age group (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Hales et al., 2018</xref>), as well as persistent socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in obesity that appear to be widening (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al., 2012</xref>). Scalable strategies to prevent obesity in young children who are disproportionately burdened by obesity are thus urgently needed.</p><p id="p0025">Cross-sector collaborations that integrate public health and clinical obesity prevention efforts have been proposed as a potentially effective, population-level strategy to reduce obesity among vulnerable children (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Kumanyika et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Nader et al., 2012</xref>). The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is a unique platform for early childhood obesity prevention in high-risk groups including racial/ethnic minority and low-income populations (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Sekhobo et al., 2012</xref>), but few community-wide obesity prevention strategies have integrated WIC. The Massachusetts Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration project (MA-CORD) is a multi-sector initiative to prevent childhood obesity among low-income children. In previous analyses, we showed that interventions delivered through MA-CORD were associated with reduced prevalence of obesity risk factors among children age 2&#x02013;4&#x0202f;years enrolled in WIC (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Woo Baidal et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding processes through which this intervention affected change will inform implementation of future population-wide efforts to curb obesity in children.</p><p id="p0030">According to social-cognitive theory, individuals who have strong beliefs in their capabilities exert more effort to accomplish an endeavor (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 1989</xref>). In other words, increasing provider confidence may lead to counseling that is more effective. In fact, in pediatric clinical settings, higher levels of provider confidence are associated with a greater extent of counseling on growth and nutrition (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 1999</xref>). Here, we examine changes in WIC provider confidence and frequency of practices related to childhood obesity prevention for those practicing in sites participating in the multi-sector MA-CORD intervention versus those in other Massachusetts sites.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study overview</title><p id="p0035">MA-CORD was a systems-level, quasi-experimental trial funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aimed to reduce childhood obesity among underserved children (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Dooyema et al., 2013</xref>). Descriptions of MA-CORD's design are provided elsewhere (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Dooyema et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, MA-CORD included evidence-informed interventions across several sectors, including schools, community health centers and WIC, that were implemented in two Massachusetts communities selected to participate as intervention sites based on size, per capita income, and prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity. In each of these sectors in both of the MA-CORD communities, we implemented evidence-based programs to promote childhood obesity prevention. The intervention start date in WIC was September 1, 2012. All MA-CORD protocols were approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health IRB. The protocol for the current study was deemed non-human subjects research by the Indiana University School of Medicine IRB.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Participants and procedures</title><p id="p0040">Participants were 370 WIC nutritionists and nutrition assistants (hereafter &#x0201c;WIC providers&#x0201d;) practicing within two low-income communities participating in MA-CORD (<italic>N</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;32) and elsewhere throughout Massachusetts (<italic>N</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;338).

WIC providers in all sites (intervention and non-intervention) provided usual care, consisting of nutrition assessment and counseling during in-person visits occurring approximately four times per year. Within MA-CORD sites, WIC providers additionally received: (1) full-day trainings on best practices and consistent delivery of MA-CORD target behavior counseling and health messaging; (2) resource and training materials; (3) information about how to incorporate MA-CORD patient and family education materials into WIC counseling; and (4) links to local MA-CORD obesity prevention initiatives and enhanced healthy weight clinic referrals. MA-CORD WIC providers also participated in a multi-sector learning collaborative and train-the-trainer programs.

We cannot determine the reason for these findings, although it is possible that the small sample size for intervention sites, which did include the majority of WIC providers in MA-CORD sites, may have reduced our ability to detect significant changes. We administered serial, cross-sectional surveys to WIC providers and, given the study design, can only determine differences between the two samples, not individual changes in confidence or frequency of practices. Thus, we cannot account for substitution of one behavioral counseling topic, such as screen time, with another, such as sleep.</p><p id="p0100">In previous analyses of MA-CORD, we found significant intervention effects related to the prevalence of child obesity-related health behaviors and decreases in BMI z-scores (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Franckle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Taveras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Woo Baidal et al., 2017</xref>). While the design of MC-CORD meant we were unable to determine specific causes of these changes, it is possible that MA-CORD specific staff training and frequent contacts with project staff in other sectors may have contributed to these effects through increases in WIC provider confidence. In other research, higher confidence is linked to a greater likelihood of behavioral change among parents (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Taveras et al., 2009</xref>). Also, similar to our current study, pediatric providers in the Texas Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (TX CORD) project reported increases in self-efficacy but did not report changes in frequency of counseling on specific topics (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Barlow et al., 2018</xref>). In that study, providers did report increased frequency of patient-centered counseling approaches over time (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Barlow et al., 2018</xref>), a facet of counseling which we were unable to examine in our current study. While the observed changes in provider confidence in our study were relatively modest and we were unable to demonstrate differences in change in provider obesity-related practice frequency, overall, our results lend support to recommendations to include WIC providers in multi-sector interventions to increase provider confidence in best practices for childhood obesity prevention. Future research should use a randomized or blinded design to test the impact of provider confidence in helping engage families to making behavior changes to prevent childhood obesity.</p><sec id="s0050"><label>4.1</label><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p id="p0105">The MA-CORD WIC intervention positively influenced WIC provider confidence in identifying childhood obesity and risk factors.
