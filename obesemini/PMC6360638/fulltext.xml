This program recognizes parents as key influencers who create the overall structure/lifestyle of the home environment. Indeed, as role models and gatekeepers, parents strongly influence children&#x02019;s weight-related behaviors<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr9-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and thus have a fundamental role in safeguarding child health by cultivating obesity-preventive home environments and lifestyle habits.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr14-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Research on the effectiveness of public service announcements and anti-tobacco advertisements has shown that the message content and emotions evoked by advertisements influence their ability to elicit behavior.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Research has also shown that the effectiveness of health-related interventions is influenced by how the content is framed.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Therefore, to increase the relevance and resonance, and thus the effectiveness, of the program, HomeStyles frames childhood obesity prevention strategies in a manner that is responsive to parent-defined quality-of-life (QOL) priorities. The concept of &#x0201c;quality of life&#x0201d; incorporates an individual&#x02019;s personal view of factors that positively and negatively affect life and the degree to which the individual feels personal needs are being satisfied and he or she is able to pursue happiness and fulfillment.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The PRECEDE-PROCEED health program planning model provides the framework for HomeStyles&#x02019; development, implementation, and evaluation process.

Yet, their role in establishing home environments and family lifestyles and serving as family gatekeepers, the impact parents can have with regard to family weight-related behaviors (e.g. foods available, screentime limits) makes it imperative to elucidate their QOL determinants in order to frame health-related messaging in a manner that is likely to encourage behavior change. Thus, to address research gaps and facilitate development of stage 2 of the HomeStyles program, the aim of this study was to determine the factors affecting the QOL of parents of school-age children, the target audience of stage 2 of HomeStyles, and subsequently apply findings to educational materials for this audience.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-2050312119828535"><title>Methods</title><p>The Institutional Review Boards for Protection of Human Subjects at the authors&#x02019; universities approved this investigation.

Personal good health was important because it helped them &#x0201c;take care of my family and make sure I am there for them.&#x0201d; Parents also noted that family health affected their QOL because &#x0201c;when someone [in the family] gets sick&#x02014;that impacts the day-to-day&#x0201d; and that &#x0201c;nothing affects me more than when my children are sick.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;Time is a big factor&#x0201d; that affected parents&#x02019; satisfaction with life. &#x0201c;Spending quality time with my family&#x0201d; &#x0201c;is more important than anything else&#x0201d; because &#x0201c;family is important to me.&#x0201d; Many felt that there is &#x0201c;never enough time in the day&#x0201d; and that they were &#x0201c;always rushing through day-to-day life&#x0201d; because of &#x0201c;busy and hectic schedules&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;need[ing] to manage my own schedule and my kids&#x02019; schedules.&#x0201d; An important contributor to time stress was children&#x02019;s activity schedules, which &#x0201c;can be very challenging to manage&#x0201d; especially because parents are &#x0201c;transporting kids to activities.&#x0201d; In addition, parents indicated that their own employment contributed to time scarcity because there is &#x0201c;never enough time between working full-time and three kids.&#x0201d; To have more time, some parents wished to &#x0201c;be in a position where I can work part-time and spend more time with my kids.&#x0201d;</p><p>English-speaking parents also cited the importance of having time away from their children: &#x0201c;something other than your family, like a career&#x0201d; and being around other adults outside the family, commenting &#x0201c;I need to be around people older than 18&#x0201d; and have a &#x0201c;connection and relationship to other people.&#x0201d; Having time for their spouse was also important, with parents remarking that they &#x0201c;want to be involved with the kids without sacrificing time with my spouse.&#x0201d; In addition, parents&#x02019; happiness depended on having personal &#x0201c;me&#x0201d; time so that they had &#x0201c;time to pursue passions and be connected to people&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;freedom to do outside things that I enjoy&#x02014;sometimes that gets put on the back burner to make the family happy.&#x0201d; To feel fulfilled, parents also wanted personal &#x0201c;time to develop goals and motivation&#x0201d; so that they could &#x0201c;better [themselves] and work toward goals.&#x0201d; Personal time was also desired to enable participation in &#x0201c;self-care&#x0201d; like &#x0201c;exercising,&#x0201d; for &#x0201c;rest and quiet time,&#x0201d; and to have &#x0201c;time to myself to relax and decompress.&#x0201d;</p><p>Having consistent employment and job security was a significant contributor to parents&#x02019; satisfaction with life because it meant that they were &#x0201c;able to provide for them [family]&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;maintain ourselves.&#x0201d; The desire to &#x0201c;feel secure financially&#x0201d; was common. &#x0201c;Financial stability is important because there is more stress when the money is tighter.&#x0201d; Having employment meant that parents were &#x0201c;able to provide for them [family],&#x0201d; &#x0201c;get bills paid,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;afford what we need,&#x0201d; and save for &#x0201c;retirement.&#x0201d; Parents also felt that &#x0201c;there is never enough money to do everything you want to do&#x0201d; and afford all the things they wanted kids to have (e.g. kids&#x02019; participation in &#x0201c;sports gets expensive&#x0201d;).</p><p>Sufficient, steady income was important; however, parents&#x02019; work responsibilities presented other challenges. Many realized that it was important to &#x0201c;not stress about work,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;separate work from home life,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;balance my family and career,&#x0201d; but found it difficult because they had set themselves &#x0201c;high expectations at work and home&#x02014;when expectations aren&#x02019;t met, then life starts to unravel.&#x0201d; In addition, parents were concerned about &#x0201c;not being in control of children&#x02019;s care during the day.&#x0201d;</p><p>Some Spanish-speaking parents reported that &#x0201c;The major factor that affects us is being undocumented; this is one of the largest barriers that we encounter.

These included education (&#x0201c;not being able to go to university&#x0201d;), timing of parenthood (&#x0201c;having kids at a young age really affected my life&#x0201d;), criminal record, and appearance choices (&#x0201c;I have tattoos and I know I am stereotyped&#x0201d;). Other barriers to happiness named were time-use decisions (&#x0201c;I spend too much time on social media&#x0201d;), &#x0201c;laziness&#x0201d; and lack of motivation, &#x0201c;emotional instability,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;bad friendships&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;toxic relationships,&#x0201d; and parenting practices (&#x0201c;I&#x02019;m not able to tell my kids &#x02018;no&#x02019;&#x0201d;).

For example, taking time to &#x0201c;provide a healthy meal&#x0201d; would help because &#x0201c;if we had better eating, it would improve our lives.&#x0201d; Other health-promoting strategies parents thought would improve life satisfaction were having a &#x0201c;bedtime routine,&#x0201d; being physically active, and limiting electronic device use (&#x0201c;the kids become so absorbed in electronics, they don&#x02019;t do anything else&#x0201d;). Psychological health was also cited as a means for improving QOL (&#x0201c;As a mom, you put yourself on the back burner; but I need to make sure I take care of myself as well. I need to get back to putting myself as a priority because I will be no good to anyone if I am not around&#x0201d;).</p><p>Adjusting their overall mind-set was also cited as a way to boost contentment with life, for example, &#x0201c;simplifying,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;slowing down,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;being more intentional about the things that really matter and not being distracted,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;lowering expectations about having to be the perfect parent and wife.&#x0201d; Acceptance was also part of the mind-set shift with parents who believed it would help &#x0201c;find happiness where you are&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;making what we have work.&#x0201d;</p><p>A few Spanish-speaking parents indicated that greater community support would improve their life satisfaction.

The discussion below describes how these findings can be used to inform future obesity prevention programs.</p><p>Parents reported that family dynamics had an impact on their QOL, stressing the importance of family members getting along and minimizing conflict. Others have reported similar findings and also identified family interactions including the time spent together, communication, love, and support as the factors influencing the QOL of parents of children with and without disabilities.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Previous interventions aiming to change health behavior have been successful at incorporating parental perceived determinants of happiness (i.e. stronger family bonds) into their materials as a strategy for promoting behavior change.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> For example, Ho et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> designed an intervention that promoted preparing and eating meals as a family as a way to improve family communication and bonding and successfully improved family health and happiness. In addition, parents identify family bonding to be a potential benefit of parent:child co-play, suggesting the potential of highlighting the family-strengthening benefits of co-physical activity in addition to its benefits to physical health.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p>Managing parent work schedules along with children&#x02019;s school and activity schedules was stressful for some parents who wanted a better sense of work&#x02013;life balance. The desire for work&#x02013;life balance is a transcultural desire; individuals who are satisfied with their work&#x02013;life balance are less anxious and are less likely to be depressed while also being more satisfied with their job.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Over half of working mothers and fathers report finding it difficult to balance work life and family life.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In addition to reducing time with family and direct supervision of children, work schedules can also negatively affect children&#x02019;s health behaviors.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> For example, nonstandard work schedules (i.e. night or evening shift work) are particularly important to consider given their links to children&#x02019;s greater risk of depression and likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors (i.e. drug use, underage drinking, sexual promiscuity).<sup><xref rid="bibr43-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Behavior change interventions that communicate benefits beyond improved health, such as increased family time (i.e. getting kids involved in meal preparation), could increase parent interest and engagement and thus the effectiveness of the health intervention.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>Some employers who have recognized the importance of promoting work&#x02013;life balance have implemented supportive programs to foster better work&#x02013;life balance for employees.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> The main constructs of these programs include emotional support (i.e. being aware of how work responsibility may affect family life, sympathy for the challenge of balancing work and family life), role modeling (i.e. sharing tips and strategies that have helped others balance work and family life), instrumental support (i.e. allowing flexibility in work schedules and offering services that assist employees in work&#x02013;family balance), and creative work&#x02013;family management (i.e. adapting workplace culture to better integrate work and family responsibilities).<sup><xref rid="bibr48-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> The moderate success of these programs<sup><xref rid="bibr46-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> suggests that incorporating their constructs in health and nutrition interventions could also address work&#x02013;life balance QOL needs within the context of the intervention goals. For instance, if parents feel unable to find time or energy to provide frequent family meals or opportunities to be physically active with their children, teaching parents how these activities contribute to their work&#x02013;life balance could enhance the attractiveness of the intervention and boost intervention recruitment and retention efforts. In addition, creating a program that is flexible and allows parents to fit it in around their busy schedule may be beneficial.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>Incorporating stress management tips related to the behaviors promoted in health programs can also address life-balance goals. A study of working mothers found a negative association between income and hair cortisol (a stress hormone) suggesting that low-income mothers experience greater levels of stress.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Mindfulness techniques, particularly in relation to mindful eating incorporated into nutrition interventions, have significantly improved maternal stress levels.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>Related to work&#x02013;life balance, parents felt that financial stability was another important factor influencing their QOL, and although parents wished to be able to work less, they indicated that working fewer hours was not feasible as their family relied on their income to pay bills and afford the things they want and need. A study of parents of 4- to 18-year-old children showed that parents are interested in health interventions that consider families&#x02019; tight budgets.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Although health education programs may not be able to increase income directly, there are many opportunities to demonstrate cost-saving strategies for performing healthful behaviors (e.g. preparing healthy meals on a budget, affordable ways families can be active together). Addressing parent concerns while increasing their self-efficacy for performing healthful behaviors may be an effective way to help parents improve their health and QOL despite a tight budget.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p><p>Focus group results also indicate that parents believed it was important for them to occasionally spend time away from their children to engage in personal pursuits, such as leisure activities. Parents who engage in personal leisure time pursuits have a greater sense of well-being, and for mothers the time spent away from children and engaging with other adults was associated with increased maternal engagement when with their children.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Thus, interventions may benefit from highlighting the potential for health-related behavior changes to also result in more leisure time for parents. For example, in addition to discussing the importance of preparing and planning meals in advance to support family health, framing the behavior as a time-saving strategy may increase parents&#x02019; desire to change behavior. This is an example of a person-based approach that highlights the importance of recognizing the needs of the individual who will use the intervention as a means for improving the effectiveness of behavior change interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr54-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup></p><p>Some of the Spanish-speaking participants reported that being undocumented had a negative effect on their QOL.

Social support has been shown to lessen the negative influence of acculturative stress on physical well-being.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Future health interventions targeting acculturating audience should not only provide culturally sensitive information delivered in the audience&#x02019;s language, but should also be aware of strategies for overcoming road blocks immigration status may pose<sup><xref rid="bibr57-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> to participation in the program and/or performance of recommended behaviors. Program characteristics that build a sense of community support, such as social media pages or events, are some strategies intervention planners could consider offering acculturating populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="bibr58-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="bibr59-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup></p><p>Parents&#x02019; health (i.e. adequate sleep, healthy diet, sufficient physical exercise) was identified as a key determinant of their QOL as it influences their ability to effectively care for their family. Children&#x02019;s health was also frequently identified as affecting parents&#x02019; QOL. Parents of generally healthy children rate their QOL significantly higher than parents of sick children,<sup><xref rid="bibr60-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> supporting the idea that a child health can have an immense impact on a family&#x02019;s QOL. Bolstering the benefits of health-related behaviors on parents&#x02019; abilities to care for their families and on children&#x02019;s health may increase parent desire to engage in healthy behavior change. For instance, interventions aiming to increase fruit and vegetable intake may be more effective if they highlight the immune boosting benefits of fruits and vegetables in addition to other benefits such as weight control.</p><p>Although obesity prevention and weight control are the ultimate goals for many researchers, weight is not a particular concern for many parents.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> This may be because many parents underestimate their children&#x02019;s weight status.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Hence, health communicators should likely consider other health-related factors affecting QOL when trying to address weight control topics.</p><p>Parents reported a few health-related factors that they believed would improve their entire family&#x02019;s QOL. One of these factors was providing healthy meals for their family, as they believed that eating healthy meals would have a positive impact on their lives. A systematic review of literature revealed that QOL is generally improved following dietary interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr62-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Although the review was unable to identify the cause of improved QOL, several potential mediators were identified including the effect of altered dietary intake on social interactions, personal satisfaction, economics, physical health, and psychological health.<sup><xref rid="bibr62-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Improving parent understanding of the benefits of a healthy diet on factors aside from weight control and improved physical health may improve the effectiveness of future dietary interventions. In addition, parents identified parent&#x02013;child co-play as a potential health-related method to improving QOL by making both parents and children happier. Future interventions could focus on both the physical and mental health benefits of active family playtime and promote the potential to build family bonds.<sup><xref rid="bibr63-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="bibr64-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup></p><p>Strengths of this study include using a theoretical framework to develop the focus group discussion guide and having highly trained focus group moderators and note-takers. A further strength is the large sample size drawn from three geographic locations. In addition, this study helps address a gap in the literature by describing the QOL determinants of parents of school-age children and can inform a wide array of interventions focusing on health. It is important to note that the findings of this study are limited in that they cannot be generalized to parents with children in other age groups or to children with chronic diseases, such as obesity.

Parents in this study reported that their families&#x02019; schedules and lifestyles had changed greatly since their children were in preschool. Thus, it can be presumed that parent&#x02019;s QOL determinants may also change as their children age. In addition, research has shown that parents of children with chronic health conditions such as autism, food allergies, diabetes, and cancer have poorer QOL and higher levels of stress and anxiety than parents of healthy children.<sup><xref rid="bibr70-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">70</xref><xref rid="bibr71-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr72-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup></p><p>Parents are children&#x02019;s primary role models, are food and physical activity gatekeepers, and establish the family lifestyle and home environment; thus, they have the opportunity to cultivate a &#x0201c;culture of health&#x0201d; in the home.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr8-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr73-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="bibr74-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> Parents also need opportunities to learn obesity prevention strategies that are matched to the realities of their lifestyles and life goals.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr75-2050312119828535" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> Obesity prevention interventions targeted to parents of school-age children that are responsive to this audience&#x02019;s QOL determinants have the potential to improve the health and QOL of the entire family.
