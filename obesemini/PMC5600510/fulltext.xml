In each of two MA-CORD communities, childhood obesity prevention interventions were implemented in the local WIC programs. This article reports the two-year outcomes of the WIC intervention delivered as part of MA-CORD among enrolled children age 2&#x02013;4 years. We used a quasi-experimental, pre-post design to compare outcomes for WIC-enrolled children in each MA-CORD intervention community to those in a comparison community. We hypothesized that children receiving WIC support in the two intervention communities, compared to those receiving WIC support in a demographically-matched Massachusetts community, would have slower rates of increase in age- and sex-specific BMI z-score over a 2-year period.

MA-CORD built upon a state public health department community level obesity prevention initiative, Mass in Motion, to extend the initiative to childhood obesity-focused intervention components in multiple sectors. The two Intervention sites and the Comparison site were selected from established Mass in Motion communities. The MA-CORD conceptual framework, intervention design and evaluation methods have been described in detail.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Briefly, MA-CORD spanned several sectors including community health centers; WIC; public elementary and middle schools; after-school settings, and the broader community. In each of these sectors in both communities, we implemented evidence-based programs to promote childhood obesity prevention. We provide a summary of the WIC intervention components that were part of MA-CORD and their effectiveness. The intervention start date in WIC was September 1, 2012. Children over age 2 years and under age 5 years were included in the evaluation. The primary outcome was rate of change in child age- and sex-specific BMI z-score over a two-year intervention period assessed using electronic WIC records from the two intervention and one comparison site.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Eligibility and Recruitment</title><p id="P9">The MA-CORD WIC study protocol was approved by the human subjects committees of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Children enrolled in WIC routinely attend nutrition assessment and counseling visits where anthropometric measurements (height and weight) are performed at least every 6 months. Each child with a qualifying WIC visit at any of the two intervention or comparison communities between October 1, 2010 and June 1, 2015 was eligible for inclusion for the primary outcome of child BMI z-score over time. A longitudinal de-identified dataset including child height and weight was extracted from the WIC electronic record. Children were considered eligible for inclusion if they had at least one visit during the pre-intervention period; had at least one visit 6 months after the intervention start date; were between age 2&#x02013;4 years at the time of the visit; and lived in a MA-CORD or comparison community at the time of the visit. To assess child behaviors, we surveyed parents of children between age 2&#x02013;4 years at baseline (September 17, 2012-February 28, 2013) and post-intervention (January 2, 2015 &#x02013; May 1, 2015) and entered responses into the WIC electronic record. We extracted a de-identified dataset including behavioral survey responses during the baseline and 2-year time period from the WIC electronic record. A waiver of informed consent was obtained and the institutional review board at Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) approved all protocols.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>WIC Intervention</title><p id="P10">WIC providers provided usual care for participants in all three sites (2 intervention and 1 comparison site). In usual care, nutritionists and nutrition assistants provide nutrition assessment and counseling to WIC participants during in-person visits at least three, but typically four, times yearly. Child weight and height are measured as part of the nutrition assessment. In Massachusetts, electronic WIC records calculate child BMI and flag abnormal values. Nutrition education is offered each time benefits are issued.</p><p id="P11">Within the MA-CORD Intervention WIC sites, evidence-informed practice changes formed the basis of WIC intervention components and have been described previously.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Briefly, MA-CORD WIC intervention components included 1) training of WIC providers in best practices and consistent delivery of MA-CORD target behavior counseling and health messaging across sectors; 2) development of MA-CORD WIC provider resource and training materials; 3) incorporation of MA-CORD patient and family educational materials into WIC participant counseling; and 4) linkage of WIC providers to local MA-CORD clinical and community obesity prevention initiatives and enhanced healthy weight clinic referrals. WIC Provider trainings were implemented in two phases. In the first phase, MA-CORD staff and MA WIC staff collaborated on the development of full-day childhood obesity prevention trainings for WIC providers in WIC Intervention sites. The curriculum included a primer on best practices in childhood obesity prevention, rationale for selection of target behaviors, a refresher on participant-centered interviewing techniques, and an overview of practical approaches to counseling on obesity risk factors. Small-group sessions for skills practice used case-based scenarios and participant-centered techniques, and a review of existing WIC education materials that aligned with MA-CORD messaging. In the second-phase, WIC providers joined with local initiatives to strengthen cross-sector collaboration. WIC providers participated in a learning collaborative with members from health care, child care, school/after-school, and community sectors. Based on WIC staff feedback, we implemented a half-day train-the-trainer program for WIC providers to enhance confidence and practices on the topics of child screen time and sleep routines, and developed new educational materials on these topics.</p><p id="P12">The target behaviors of MA-CORD in the WIC sector were elimination of sugar-sweetened beverage intake and limitation of 100% juice intake; replacement of non-nutritious foods with fruit and vegetables; limitation of screen time to no more than 2 hours daily and elimination of televisions from bedrooms; at least 1 hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily; and an average of 11 hours of sleep for children between age 2&#x02013;4 years.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Outcome Measurements</title><p id="P13">In routine practice standardized across the three WIC sites, trained WIC staff measured children&#x02019;s weight using calibrated scales and children&#x02019;s height using a stadiometer<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and entered the data into an electronic record.

For the main outcome of BMI z-score, we assessed longitudinal change in individual-level BMI z-scores in each MA-CORD intervention community compared to change in the comparison community, using multilevel, mixed effects linear regression. Models were adjusted for child age, gender, and race/ethnicity. By analyzing repeated BMI z-score measures at the individual-level in this manner, observations within person over time and within community were taken into account. To be considered in the analysis, each child had to have at least one measurement before (i.e., &#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d;) and at least one measurement six months after (i.e., &#x0201c;follow-up&#x0201d;) the intervention began.</p><p id="P16">To examine community-level pre-post differences in behavior, we compared two cross-sectional samples, drawn from all three sites before and after the intervention. Reported behaviors were coded dichotomously and reflected meeting vs. not meeting recommendations for that behavior (e.g., reporting physical activity at least 1 hour per day/7 days per week). To assess differences in behavior before and after the intervention, we used multi-level multivariable logistic regression models. Regression models were adjusted for random effect of community, and for fixed effects of child age, gender, and race/ethnicity. An interaction term was computed for each MA-CORD community to assess time by community (i.e, intervention compared to control community) effects for each behavior. SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC) was used for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S12"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="P17">Across the two intervention and one comparison sites, 11,876 children age 2&#x02013;4 years had an eligible visit between October 1, 2010 and June 1, 2015 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

When all children were included in the BMI z-score analyses, the difference in BMI z-scores were not statistically significant. However, differences in race/ethnicity and prevalence of overweight/obesity existed between communities at baseline. In the comparison community, more children were of Asian ancestry and fewer children had overweight or obesity. After excluding Asian children, the difference in BMI z-score for WIC-enrolled children in Intervention site #2 was statistically significant.</p><p id="P23">We also found improvements in prevalence of obesity-related behaviors in MA-CORD WIC Intervention sites in comparison to the usual care site. Children in WIC Intervention site #1 showed improvements in elimination of SSB intake, daily physical activity, avoiding TVs in bedrooms, and sleep sufficiency. Children in WIC Intervention site #2 had improvements in SSB intake, juice intake, and sleep. These results suggest that the MA-CORD intervention components positively influenced population-level behavior change among low-income children.</p><p id="P24">MA-CORD is one of the few studies that has implemented and evaluated community-wide efforts to reduce childhood obesity in low-income settings in the US, and is unique in its inclusion of WIC as an intervention and evaluation sector. In Shape Up Somerville, a multi-level community-based intervention in Massachusetts, school-aged children (mean baseline age 7.61 years) in an intervention community had a &#x02212;0.06 decrease in BMI z-score compared to control sites.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Shape Up Somerville had school-, home-, and community-based intervention components, with BMI outcomes measured in school settings. Given the similar magnitude of decrease in BMI z-score, our results extend this prior research to younger children and support the importance of including WIC in multi-sector interventions.</p><p id="P25">In addition to the similarities in magnitude of BMI z-score findings between Shape Up Somerville and MA-CORD, the impact of MA-CORD WIC Intervention components on child BMI z-score and behaviors is supported by the inclusion of a Comparison site that was part of the Mass in Motion initiative. The Mass in Motion initiative is a state public health initiative that seeks to curb obesity in Massachusetts communities, but did not previously include intervention components tailored to early childhood. By including WIC in MA-CORD Intervention communities and creating age-appropriate and linguistically-tailored intervention tools, the MA-CORD WIC Intervention expanded existing Mass in Motion efforts to children age 2&#x02013;4 years. As none of the three sites were restricted from participating in other educational campaigns and the comparison site was a Mass in Motion site, our results show the effect of including targeted efforts to prevent obesity among young children, an age group that shows promise for responding to obesity prevention efforts in national data. <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p id="P26">Children with a healthy weight at age five years are likely to maintain a healthy weight throughout childhood, and modifiable early childhood obesity risk factors, including SSB consumption, excessive juice intake, lack of physical activity, and insufficient sleep, contribute to development of an unhealthy weight.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Efforts to reduce early childhood obesity risk factors must incorporate settings that will reach children early in life in order to successfully reduce subsequent childhood obesity. An estimated 8 million women, infants, and children participated in WIC during fiscal year 2015, demonstrating an important potential reach for childhood obesity prevention initiatives.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Given the high prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity in MA-CORD intervention communities, our findings suggest that a multi-level, multi-sector intervention improved target intervention behaviors in WIC-enrolled children who are at disproportionate risk for obesity. These results support the inclusion of WIC in multi-sector interventions to promote a healthy weight for low-income children under age five years, thus reducing disparities in childhood obesity.</p><p id="P27">The MA-CORD study has several unique features that will inform future efforts to reverse the high prevalence of childhood obesity. First, we worked with key WIC stakeholders at local and state levels to enhance linkage with existing clinical and community resources. Second, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) led the MA-CORD intervention implementation and evaluation. The bulk of the intervention components in WIC focused on systems-level changes by enhancing WIC providers&#x02019; ability to address obesity-related behaviors in children through one day of training, a train-the-trainer program, and consistent multi-sector linkages that can be replicated in other settings. By working with MDPH, WIC, and several other existing infrastructures, we strengthened the ability to scale-up the MA-CORD model to disseminate evidence-based interventions. Finally, although this paper reports outcomes in WIC-enrolled children, child BMI and target behaviors were measured in primary care and school settings, and findings will be reported elsewhere. Thus, MA-CORD truly represents a multisector approach to implementation and evaluation of childhood obesity prevention interventions in low-income communities.</p><p id="P28">Because the goal of this research was to evaluate the implementation of best practices for childhood obesity prevention across multiple sectors and levels in communities, randomization of intervention components was not feasible. Some imbalance between community demographics may have limited our ability to detect differences between groups as the comparison community had more underweight and Asian children than MA-CORD sites. Also, we are unable to quantify the effect of sector-specific doses of MA-CORD intervention components on BMI or to account for other initiatives to promote healthy behaviors that took place in MA-CORD or comparison communities during the intervention period. Additionally, because behavior data was obtained from serial, cross-sectional data, we were unable to attribute specific behaviors with changes in BMI z-score. Also, because behaviors were parent-reported, social desirability on the part of parents or WIC providers could have influenced behavior results. To reduce the possibility of reporting bias, we used previously validated questions. Additionally, WIC providers performed BMI and behavior assessments in either an intervention or a usual care site, not in both, thus reducing the risk for bias related to selective reporting. Overall, this research demonstrates the real-world effective of implementing interventions shown to be efficacious in BMI reduction.</p><p id="P29">In conclusion, the MA-CORD intervention was associated with improvements in BMI z-scores over 2 years in WIC-enrolled children in one of two intervention communities, and improvements in prevalence of intervention target behaviors in both intervention sites. Our findings demonstrate that WIC-enrolled children ages 2&#x02013;4 years living in low-income communities with high prevalence of childhood obesity improved obesity risk factors in the context of a community-wide intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (Award no.: U18DP003370).
