The 2014&#x02013;15 National Health Survey data showed that overweight and obesity in children rose from 25.7% in 2011&#x02013;12 to 27.4% in 2014&#x02013;15 [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Obesity in children is associated with numerous health risks including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, gall bladder disease, cancer, mental illness and predisposition to adulthood obesity [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Further, the economic burden of obesity in industrialised countries including Australia is on the rise with the most recent estimate showing that the total cost of obesity in Australia was $8.6 billion as of 2012 and the estimated health and wellbeing cost to individuals from obesity being $47.4 billion in 2011&#x02013;12, including the impact of obesity on quality of life and length of life [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Further, obesity prevention alone entails an annual spending of $145 million in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Although, the National Preventative Health Strategy had committed to reducing health inequities by targeting disadvantage, overweight and obesity rates continue to rise among disadvantaged populations including culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities, indigenous populations and low socioeconomic groups, who bear a disproportionate burden of childhood overweight and obesity (32%), compared to children from the mainstream Australian-born English-speaking populations (25%) [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CALD communities are defined as those people born overseas, in countries other than those classified by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) as &#x0201c;main English speaking countries&#x0201d; which include New Zealand, the United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada, Ireland and South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. CALD communities include those who speak a language other than English as their first spoken language and possess limited proficiency in English [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As of 2015, nearly 20% of Australia&#x02019;s population was made up of CALD groups [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the last two decades, numerous obesity prevention initatives implemented in Australia and New Zealand managed to reduce childhood obesity among mainstream populations [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] however, they not only failed to achieve obesity reduction when implemented among CALD communities, but also led to an increase in their obesity prevalence rates [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indeed, there is growing concern over the existing obesity prevention initiatives ineffectively targeting disadvantaged populations thereby worsening the existing childhood obesity-related disparities in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>There is increasing recognition among policymakers and service providers, that using a cross-cultural multi-pronged approach involving a range of stakeholders from government, health services, schools and early years&#x02019; services, is a crucial step in reducing childhood obesity-related disparities [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Past research has shown that engaging key stakeholders who have an ongoing involvement in the health and wellbeing of young children including modifying factors that contribute to child unhealthy weight gain, can achieve obesity reduction [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

However, in Australia, while studies have examined the perspectives of service providers to improve childhood obesity prevention among mainstream Australian populations, no such studies have been conducted to improve childhood obesity prevention among CALD populations [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Currently there is a gap in the knowledge of service providers&#x02019; perspectives of the various barriers impacting the effective utilisation of childhood obesity prevention services by CALD communities in Australia. Through the lens of service providers, this study aimed to address this evidence gap and enable the identification of key changes to the existing childhood obesity prevention policy and practice, in order to improve the delivery of obesity prevention services to CALD communities in Victoria, Australia. We used a qualitative approach to capture the views of a diverse sample of key service providers on the barriers and facilitators to participation of CALD communities in childhood obesity prevention initiatives. Findings from this qualitative research will enable policymakers and service providers to address the current gaps in childhood obesity prevention service delivery and utilisation among CALD communities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>We conducted a qualitative study using focus group discussions to explore key stakeholders&#x02019; perspectives on the engagement of CALD communities in childhood obesity prevention initiatives, to generate knowledge in an area where there has been minimal prior research and to maximise the effect of group synergies through spontaneous discussions [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Focus groups have the advantage of interactions within the groups, which allow greater exploration of individual and shared perspectives on a particular topic thereby opening up a range of views [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The study participants included service providers involved in the health and wellbeing of children living in the socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of Maribyrnong, Hume, Brimbank and Greater Dandenong in Victoria, with an Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage score of &#x0003c;1000 per area. More than 50% of the population in these areas are comprised of migrants and refugees [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Based on the advice of the study steering committee which included study investigators, city council staff, maternal and child health (MCH) team-leaders, community health centre managers and primary school wellbeing officers, the research staff conducted face to face meetings with city council representatives of child wellbeing in the four study areas to finalise the process of recruitment. School and kindergarten teachers, playgroup facilitators, health promotion officers, MCH nurses, dieticians, school nurses, day-care centre staff and refugee health nurses, who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria, were purposefully recruited by research staff. Interested stakeholders were given a plain language summary of the study and followed up with phone calls to organise a suitable time for the focus group. Participants were included in the study if they were a) currently employed in kindergartens, primary schools, playgroups, childcare centres, kindergartens, city councils, community health centres, MCH services and Refugee Health services; b) currently working in one of the four areas of greater Melbourne, Australia: Maribyrnong, Hume, Brimbank and Greater Dandenong local government areas. Participants were excluded if they were not a stakeholder of the above-mentioned groups and not employed in any one of the four disadvantaged areas.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data were collected using eight heterogeneous focus groups (two per geographical area) comprising approximately eight participants (group number ranging from 6 to 9). Each focus group was constructed to include a mix of service providers across a range of community and early years&#x02019; services in order to obtain diverse views on the topics discussed. Across all the four study areas, care was taken to ensure the similar composition of groups. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data collection. Focus groups were conducted by the lead author (SC) and co-facilitated by another member of the research team, in centrally situated locations including community centres, city council offices, and public libraries in each study area, which were convenient and accessible to study participants. Each focus group was around 2 hours long and was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Field notes were taken describing the group dynamics and participant interactions. The focus group discussions were guided by a schedule of four topics identified from the existing literature on childhood obesity among CALD communities [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The focus group schedule was informed by the agency-structure sociological theory which states that human behaviour is governed by the capacity of individuals to make change (agency) and the social, economic and political contexts within which behaviour change takes place (structure) [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This theory enabled us to develop a schedule which allowed for exploration of both the service providers&#x02019; roles as well as the structure and delivery of services pertaining to childhood obesity prevention. Topics were the service providers&#x02019; perceptions of: childhood obesity prevention among CALD communities; service provider roles and responsibilities for promoting healthy eating and physical activity behaviours among CALD communities; barriers and facilitators to the effective utilisation of childhood obesity prevention services by CALD communities; and potential solutions at community and system levels to improve the participation of CALD communities in obesity prevention services. The development of the focus group schedule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162184.s001">S1 File</xref>) was overseen by the study steering committee. Data were collected until the study steering committee were satisfied that the focus group schedule topics were adequately covered and no new information emerged (data saturation). Transcripts were shown to study participants who verified and approved the content prior to the commencement of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We analysed the data for emergent themes based on grounded theory [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] with two researchers AR and SC, following a six-step thematic analysis approach recommended by Braun and Clarke [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] as follows: 1) Familiarisation with the data by reading the field notes and transcripts in detail; 2) Generation of initial codes across the entire set of transcripts and collating data relevant to each code; 3) Grouping codes into potential themes and gathering all relevant data to each theme; 4) Thematic mapping to review the themes and check if they work in relation to the coded extracts; 5) Defining and naming the themes; and 6) Narration of the themes and sub-themes, with selection of quotations from the raw data to exemplify the unique characteristics of participants&#x02019; perceptions. Trustworthiness of the data was ensured by adopting the process of member checks wherein the study participants were given the data analysis report to verify the accuracy of the findings based on their actual experiences. Further, iterative questioning using probes was done to elicit detailed data from participants to complement responses and refer to concepts previously raised by participants to establish clarity, and document synergy and contradictions in participants&#x02019; responses.

We found that service providers perceived CALD communities to have low levels of health literacy which resulted in their poor engagement with health interventions, a finding shown in other studies as well [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Health literacy involves cognitive and social skills including cultural and conceptual knowledge, listening, speaking, writing and reading skills which influence the ability of individuals to use information in ways which promote and maintain good health [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Service providers in our study also perceived CALD communities to have low prose literacy levels due to which they were unable to use textual health information. This finding was supported by two recent Australian studies which indicated that 50.5% of Australians whose first language is not English (vs. 44.3% of Australian-born) fall below level 3 on the prose literacy scale (minimum level for coping with the demands of everyday life and working in an advanced society) [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>We found a mismatch between the health information provided and the information needs of CALD communities. Service providers perceived that CALD communities preferred oral explanations of health concepts as opposed to the mere provision of written health information. Oral literacy or use of the spoken word has been advocated as a key method of transmitting health-related knowledge among CALD groups [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Service providers in our study emphasised the need for improvement in visual literacy, that is, the use of images to support textual and spoken health information, a strategy which has been successfully used in migrant groups with limited literacy [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This finding is not surprising because past studies have shown that the sole dependence on printed health materials without accompanying illustrations, repetition of specific key messages, and affirming the understandability of the provided information with the group, can lead to decreased motivation among ethnic groups from participating in health services [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Service providers were concerned about the sources of health information sought by CALD parents and the credibility of these sources, as many of them relied heavily on internet sources with misinformation being the chief concern. Studies have shown that CALD groups often rely on the internet, television and radio to obtain health-related information which could be an important contributing factor to their choices regarding lifestyle behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Further, we found that service providers acknowledged their lack of knowledge on the culturally mediated influences on health literacy which challenged their obesity prevention efforts in the community, this finding was in agreement with other previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>Low health literacy levels among CALD communities played a pivotal role in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours due to which these communities adopted unhealthy lifestyle patterns. Evidence shows that poor health literacy is associated with poor preventative health behaviours and health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Further, we found that CALD communities&#x02019; low health literacy levels also negatively impacted their parental role modelling behaviours, where the unhealthy practices at home interfered with children&#x02019;s adoption of healthy behaviours taught in schools, a finding shown in other studies as well [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Additionally, service providers reported on the intergenerational knowledge gap on healthy lifestyle behaviours found among CALD parents which prevented their effective engagement in school-based obesity prevention activities. Renzaho et al [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] have shown that the intergenerational gap in migrant families is due to the differences in the rate of acculturation between parents and children, with children acculturating much faster and adopting the host society&#x02019;s lifestyle behaviours compared to their parents. Studies have shown that if childhood obesity is only addressed in schools without corresponding parental health education to bridge the intergenerational knowledge gap, successful achievement of program outcomes is unlikely [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>Service providers in our study perceived CALD groups to have a poor understanding of the concept of prevention which influenced their motivations to participate in childhood obesity prevention initiatives such as MCH services. Studies have shown that although health practitioners view CALD groups as having poor interest in preventive health care, their limited participation in preventive health interventions has been attributed to their low health literacy levels [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. We also found that poor preventive service participation including MCH clinic attendance by CALD parents led to their lack of knowledge of childhood obesity prevention concepts such as the timely introduction of solid food, healthy lunch boxes and portion control. Additionally, staffing and funding inadequacies in the current dietetic and MCH services, further impeded the utilisation of these services by CALD communities. Service providers in our study lacked the knowledge and skills to address the various cultural barriers experienced by CALD communities in acknowledging childhood obesity as an issue of concern. The existing literature shows that cultural awareness is a prerequisite to achieving cultural competency and implementing childhood obesity prevention initiatives without addressing the cultural barriers will result in culturally incompetent program delivery and poor engagement by CALD communities [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>This study showed that service providers reported on the cultural misconceptions surrounding the cause of childhood obesity including the belief that obesity is solely influenced by genetics rather than lifestyle factors. Additionally, studies have shown that CALD groups&#x02019; participation in obesity prevention services are impacted by their cultural beliefs around the causes of childhood obesity [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Evidence shows that causal beliefs on illness are known to impact participation in health services and affect treatment outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In particular, the mismatch between the beliefs of ethnic groups and Western health practitioners can act as a barrier to the health service utilisation of these groups [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Incorporating the causal beliefs of CALD groups in the design of culturally-appropriate strategies has the potential to improve their health program participation [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Other key factors considered important in the development of culturally appropriate obesity prevention strategies include, improving health literacy levels among CALD parents, addressing the intergenerational acculturation gap, providing adequate linguistic support, maximising community ownership of programs using community health workers and bridging the gap in beliefs and attitudes towards childhood obesity between the health providers and CALD communities [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p><p>Apart from the cultural barriers, we found that compared to mainstream populations, service providers avoided the discussion of childhood obesity with CALD groups due to the presence of obesity-related stigma prevailing among these groups, which undermined their efforts in providing equitable care to CALD groups. Similarly, a systematic review showed that service providers often modified their approach with immigrant patients due to fears of raising sensitive issues related to pre-migratory traumatic experiences and adopted a superficial practice of care, resulting in several underlying barriers to healthy lifestyle adoption among migrant populations, not being addressed [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].</p><p>Our study showed that the lack of clear policy guidelines on childhood obesity prevention caused miscommunication between service providers and lack of clarity on the delineation of their roles and responsibilities towards addressing childhood obesity, which led to the formation of silos at both systemic and community levels. Overall, service providers highlighted the need for collaborative approaches between the medical and social models of health, including coordination between prevention and treatment services, and improved community ownership of initiatives. They proposed the incorporation of healthy eating concepts within community-level initiatives and capacity-building of settlement service staff to educate CALD groups on the available obesity prevention services, which would not only foster healthy lifestyle behaviour among these groups but also facilitate their integration into the host society. The existing literature shows similar findings which involve stakeholders from outside the health sector to adopt a multi-level coordinated approach to childhood obesity prevention [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Service providers in our study identified the lack of continuity in the current MCH childhood obesity monitoring beyond the age of four years, which also affected the availability of childhood obesity data.</p><p>Our study showed that across all services there was consensus on the lack of data on childhood obesity. Absence of epidemiological obesity data is reflective of the lack of prioritisation of childhood obesity surveillance by the local and state governments in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Contrastingly, population-level childhood obesity surveillance has been prioritised in several developed countries. The WHO European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative in 2006 ensured the collection of school-aged children&#x02019;s BMI across 13 European countries [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Further, governments in USA and UK have mandated routine, regular BMI data collection systems at school levels. The only obesity data currently available in Australia are from population health surveys which report on the nation-wide prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity every three years [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, this data is insufficient to inform the progress of current obesity interventions or their accurate evaluation and demonstration of successful outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p><p>Despite the establishment of robust school-based obesity surveillance systems in other developed countries, we found that according to the current school policies in Australia, school staff were forced to rely on parental perception of overweight and obesity in order for children to be weighed in schools. With CALD parents often being in denial of overweight and influenced by the stigmatisation of obesity, they were highly unlikely to request school &#x02018;weigh-ins&#x02019;. Evidence shows that parents from CALD backgrounds were more likely to misclassify their child&#x02019;s weight [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Schools have been cited as one of the most conducive environments for collecting data on weight and height among young children, and collaborative approaches involving schools, health systems and the government can improve the success rate of school-based childhood obesity monitoring programs [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p><p>We found that service providers advocated the use of bicultural workers to evaluate the current levels of healthy lifestyle knowledge among CALD groups and the kind of information these groups would require, in order to tailor health information materials according to their literacy levels. The existing literature shows that bicultural workers provide an ethno-cultural perspective of childhood obesity prevention among CALD groups and enable an understanding of the information needs of these groups [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Service providers in our study also recommended the training of bicultural workers as playgroup facilitators to enable them to disseminate health messages to CALD groups and function as links between MCH services and CALD parents. Given the rising immigration rates from developing countries into Australia, the bicultural workforce needs special attention regarding their inclusion into the existing service provider workforce. Bicultural workers would also facilitate the tailoring of health programs to accommodate the literacy needs and cultural norms of the CALD groups. Being representatives of the cultural community they originate from, bicultural workers have the potential to influence health behaviour change within their respective ethnic communities through trust-building, and act as a link between the health system and these communities [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].</p><sec id="sec029"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>We collected data from service providers in four disadvantaged areas and across a diverse range of services which improves the generalisability of study findings to childhood obesity prevention among CALD groups in other disadvantaged areas.

However, the consistency in themes across the four areas highlight the representativeness of service providers&#x02019; perspectives and strengthen the study findings. We were not able to recruit general practitioners and clinicians in this study due to their time constraints in focus group participation, and given their key role in addressing childhood obesity, we consider this as a limitation of this study. There were more female than male participants in this study, however given the predominance of female employees such as nurses, teachers, child care staff and playgroup leaders in the health services and early years&#x02019; services, we were unable to achieve gender balance in our study sample. Despite this imbalance, we were not able to detect any differences between the perspectives of male and female participants in our study.</p><p>As we have conducted numerous previous studies examining the views of target CALD groups in obesity prevention and health service utilisation [<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162184.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], we conducted this study with the sole purpose of obtaining the views of service providers in the delivery of obesity prevention services among CALD groups. This study has uncovered the various barriers impacting the effective delivery of obesity prevention services among CALD groups and the key areas of improvement needed to address these barriers. Nevertheless, we cite the lack of simultaneous collection of data from CALD groups in this study as a limitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Conclusion and Policy Implications</title><p>This study has highlighted the key factors influencing the engagement of CALD groups in obesity preventive services, including low CALD health literacy and co-existing deficiencies in the structure and delivery of obesity prevention services. Capacity-building of the bicultural workforce to improve health literacy among CALD groups and facilitate the CALD communities&#x02019; ownership of childhood obesity prevention initiatives, is recommended. Adequate cultural competency training of service providers is urgently needed in order to achieve the design and delivery of culturally tailored obesity prevention initiatives. Further, service providers need to be educated on CALD communities&#x02019; pre-migratory health service experiences and health conditions, in order to avoid a superficial delivery of care which fails to address the underlying barriers unique to the migrant population. Ongoing childhood obesity surveillance through robust school-based obesity monitoring systems including the training of school staff to maximise data consistency and quality, is crucial to the evaluation of evidence-based interventions. The existence of childhood obesity surveillance data will also enable the identification of high-risk groups and the development of targeted interventions which will ultimately carry the potential of reducing obesity-related disparities.</p><p>Obesity prevention needs to be supported by policy changes from all levels of the government; the Federal government to implement changes to the environmental and food industry &#x02018;upstream&#x02019; factors; the State government to coordinate the development of integrated approaches tackling behavioural modification &#x02018;midstream&#x02019; factors in educational and community services; and finally the local government to design and implement interventions targeting &#x02018;downstream&#x02019; or individual-level factors among high risk groups. Due to various cultural, linguistic and religious barriers impacting the social integration of migrants and their effective community participation, culturally congruent multidisciplinary approaches need to be implemented to address these barriers at individual, community and systems levels. With obesity contributing to the second highest burden of disease in Australia, collaborative approaches between health systems, immigrant services, early years&#x02019; services and community health services will go a long way in effectively addressing the disproportionate burden of childhood obesity among disadvantaged communities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162184.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Focus Group Schedule.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162184.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0162184.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">AIHW (2014) Australia's health 2014: 6.6 Childhood overweight and obesity.
