The latest epidemiological studies have found that there were 107.7 million children who were obese in the world in 2015, and the growth rate of childhood obesity has been greater than the growth rate of adult obesity in many countries.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Strong evidences have shown that excess weight during childhood is a predictor of future obesity, with high incidence of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal diseases, and some cancers at early younger age.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> In fact, cardiovascular disease risk factor, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and poor cardiorespiratory fitness in obese children, are becoming more common. In particular, poor cardiorespiratory fitness is considered to be an important predictor of cardiovascular disease, which has attracted more attention in recent research.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Physical activity is a critical component in managing childhood obesity, and it has been recommended by both the American College of Sports Medicine and WHO that children and adolescents should perform at least 60&#x0200a;minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and at least 3 times per week of high-intensity exercise. In pediatric population, the traditional methods to increase physical activity have principally used continuous training, which trend to rely on longer-duration sessions involving moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT).<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Although previous studies have examined that MICT is associated with significant reduction in body fat and cardiovascular risk factor in obese children and adolescents, studies have shown that the majority of children failed to meet the recommended physical activity guidelines, such as only 30% of school-aged children met MVPA recommendations in China.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Lacking of time has been considered as main barriers. Therefore, it is necessary to exploring more time-efficient exercise modality for obese children and adolescents.</p><p>High-intensity interval training (HIIT), defined as alternate short bursts of high-intensity exercise and light exercise or passive recovery periods, has been considered as an alternative and time-efficient strategy to MICT. The emerging evidence has revealed that HIIT could lead to greater or comparable abdominal and visceral fat mass loss and cardiorespiratory fitness improvement than MICT among overweight and obese adults,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and could more effectively reduce metabolic risk factors in type 2 diabetes, indicating that HIIT may be a superior modality to keep cardiometabolic health.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, a meta-analysis conducted by Wewege et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> showed that short-term HIIT could elicit modest improvement in body fat and waist circumference in overweight and obese adults, which can reduce 40% times commitment each week compared with MICT. However, HIIT performed in obese children and adolescents is significantly less investigated than adults and chronic disease patients; it still remains uncertain whether it is the best form of exercise for obese children and adolescents to lose fat and maintain cardiometabolic health. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to analyze the published studies that investigated the effects of HIIT versus MICT on fat loss and cardiometabolic health in pediatric obesity.</p><sec><label>1.2</label><title>Review objectives</title><p>We expect to try to answer the following questions through meta-analysis: whether HIIT is effective in losing weight and reducing cardiovascular risk factors, and whether it is more effective than MICT. A better understanding of the differences between HIIT and MICT on weight loss and health benefits in childhood obesity will better inform development of exercise intervention strategy to prevention and treatment of childhood obesity.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Protocol and registration</title><p>The protocol of this meta-analysis followed the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P),<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and this protocol has been registered in Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number: CRD42018111308).</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Search strategy</title><p>Relevant studies in Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and CNKI will be searched for studies with language restriction in English and Chinese, which was published from inception to January 1, 2019.

Sensitivity analyses will be further used to reduce heterogeneity by removing studies at high risk of bias or using a 1-by-1 exclusion approach to explore sources of heterogeneity. Sources of heterogeneity will be investigated by meta-regression, which are using age, sex, BMI, exercise intensity, and duration of training as covariates. Funnel plots and Egger test will be used to investigate publication bias.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis protocol to compare HIIT and MICT on fat loss and cardiometabolic health in pediatric obesity. Completing this protocol will determine whether or not HIIT is a superior modality for obese children and adolescents in reducing body fat and improving cardiometabolic health than MICT. Lastly, we feel that this study may lead to several recommendations, for both parents and researchers, as which is the best exercise modality for obese children and adolescents, and what kind of exercise modality need to be designed in weight loss program.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Jing-Xin Liu contributed to study conception and design, drafting the submitted article, and critically revising the draft for important intellectual content.
