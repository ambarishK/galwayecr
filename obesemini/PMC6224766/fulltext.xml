This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted version of the ToyBox intervention&#x02014;a preschool obesity prevention programme&#x02014;for use in Scotland (ToyBox-Scotland). This will inform the design of a full-scale cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The ToyBox-Scotland intervention will be evaluated using a feasibility cluster RCT, which involves children aged 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;years at six preschools in Glasgow, three randomly assigned to the intervention group and three to the usual-care control group. The original ToyBox intervention was adapted for the Scottish context using a coproduction approach. Within the 18-week intervention, physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be targeted in the preschool through environmental changes to the classroom, physical activity sessions and movement breaks. Parents will receive home activity packs every 3&#x02009;weeks containing sticker incentives and interactive parent&#x02013;child games that target sedentary behaviour, physical activity, eating/snacking and water consumption. As this is a feasibility study, parameters such as recruitment rates, attrition rates and SDs of outcome measures will be obtained which will inform a power calculation for a future RCT. Additional variables to be assessed include accelerometer-measured physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep, body mass index, home screen time, eating/snacking and water consumption. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 14&#x02013;17 weeks later. Intervention fidelity will be assessed using questionnaires and interviews with parents and practitioners, observation and session delivery records.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study was granted ethical approval by the University of Strathclyde&#x02019;s School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee.

Recent research has demonstrated that physical inactivity and SB in the early years tracks into later childhood and adolescence.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Specifically, children who engage in healthy behaviours from an early age are more likely to maintain such behaviours throughout childhood,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> potentially preventing the onset of obesity when it is perhaps more difficult to reverse.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Results of obesity prevention interventions targeting preschool children (3&#x02013;5&#x02009;years old) are equivocal.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Some reported encouraging findings regarding weight-related outcomes,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;32</xref> while others were ineffective.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;36</xref> Interestingly, successful interventions tend to have similar characteristics in that they target multiple behaviours (eg,&#x000a0;PA and diet) and/or multiple environments (eg, preschool and home). Two examples are the 14-week US Hip Hop to Health study<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and the year-long Spanish Ballabeina Study<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> in which the preschool and home-based interventions led to significantly improved weight-related outcomes in comparison to control groups. A novel strength of the Hip Hop to Health study was that it improved weight-related outcomes in a hard-to-reach minority group. Such findings highlight the importance of focusing on obesity prevention efforts both at preschool and at home, and the benefit of adapting interventions in order to successfully engage specific population groups.</p><p>In Scotland, children between the ages of 3 and 5&#x02009;years are entitled to 600&#x02009;hours of free childcare per year, which the majority of children spend in a preschool setting.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> As these children still spend a substantial amount of time at home, it is important that interventions contain a home-based component in order to target obesity-related health behaviours across both environments.</p><p>ToyBox is one such intervention which was developed to prevent obesity in young children from varying backgrounds through the use of a multicomponent, evidence-based&#x000a0;and theory-based, family-involved intervention implemented in preschools and homes across six European countries from 2012 to 2013.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Extensive intervention development and site-specific adaptation was undertaken, detailed elsewhere.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;43</xref> ToyBox aimed to improve energy balance-related behaviours through the delivery of teacher-led PA and SB sessions, promotion of water and healthy snacking/eating, environmental changes to the classroom, and parental education materials and parent&#x02013;child activities. Evaluations of ToyBox have demonstrated that the intervention was feasible, while significant improvements in PA and SBs were observed.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> In the Belgian cohort, children at intervention preschools significantly increased their vigorous PA (&#x000df;=1.47, p=0.03) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (&#x000df;=1.27, p=0.03) from baseline to follow-up, while control participant&#x02019;s activity levels remained constant or decreased.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Furthermore, while there were no significant interaction effects on SB for the total sample, among children who spent the most time in sedentary activities at baseline, a significant reduction in objectively measured sedentary time of &#x02212;4.17% was observed for the intervention group in comparison to the control group (&#x02212;0.41%).<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Process evaluation of the intervention has also identified important areas for consideration in any future expansion or adaptation of the intervention, such as the need for more active parental involvement.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Due to the differences between preschools in Scotland/the UK and other European countries, the feasibility and efficacy of the programme cannot be assumed and must therefore be tested following appropriate adaptation. Interventions which are not appropriately adapted to the specific environment, often fail to have the desired impact. Therefore, extensive adaptation of intervention components and stakeholder involvement is becoming an increasingly common practice in intervention development and adaptation,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> in addition to feasibility testing prior to full-scale evaluation.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The present feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the feasibility of the culturally adapted ToyBox intervention for use in Scotland (ToyBox-Scotland), a country with high childhood obesity rates.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> As this is a feasibility study, the primary aim will be to assess whether progression to a full-scale cluster RCT is merited through the evaluation of important aspects such as intervention fidelity and acceptability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This protocol has been prepared in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials statement.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49 50</xref></p><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>This intervention was adapted with the assistance of an early years practitioner and staff at a local authority preschool.

Eleven preschools expressed an interest. The majority of these preschools were located within the 20% most deprived areas in Scotland as defined by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). The SIMD compiles data on a number of domains including education, crime, health, income and housing to develop an area-based indicator of deprivation for all neighbourhoods in Scotland. Six preschools with similar SIMD scores (all with low-medium deprivation scores), demographics and class size were invited to participate. A seventh preschool with similar characteristics to the study preschools agreed to assist with adaptation and coproduction of the intervention, which is discussed in more detail later. Preschool head teachers were provided with information sheets when approached to participate. All parents/caregivers of preschool year children aged 3&#x02013;5 years at participating preschools received an information sheet detailing the intervention and data collection procedures via preschool staff, along with a consent form for their child&#x02019;s participation in data collection.

The ToyBox-study had four main areas of focus (ie,&#x000a0;PA, SB, healthy snacking and water consumption) as detailed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Classroom activities focused on each targeted behaviour for four consecutive weeks, before the cycle was repeated for a further 2&#x02009;weeks for each behaviour. Classroom guides were designed for each targeted health behaviour containing instructions for the set-up and delivery of activities and workshops, in addition to interactive stories involving cartoon animal role models. Practitioners were given autonomy in choosing activities from the provided classroom guides to deliver throughout the day and week. However, they were encouraged to deliver sessions totalling 1&#x02009;hour per week, and to gradually introduce more advanced activities from the classroom guides as the intervention progressed. Teachers were provided with training on the programme delivery before starting the intervention.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Original ToyBox-study intervention structure for classroom and home behaviour focus<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="top" colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">First focus</td><td valign="top" colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Repetition</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4&#x02009;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4&#x02009;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4&#x02009;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4&#x02009;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x02009;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x02009;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x02009;weeks</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x02009;weeks</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Water drinking</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physical activity</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eating and snacking</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sedentary behaviour</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Water drinking</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physical activity</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eating and snacking</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sedentary behaviour</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The family-based component of the intervention involved the provision of tip cards, posters and newsletters to parents/caregivers.

However, adaptations have been made to reflect the cultural, legislative and infrastructural differences between preschools in Scotland and the other European countries included in the original ToyBox-study, a practice supported by intervention development literature.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> During initial planning of ToyBox-Scotland, regular meetings were held with Glasgow City Council&#x02019;s education services team where the content and relevance of the original intervention materials were discussed, and the components of the intervention were assessed to ensure they aligned with key healthy weight policies for Scotland.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55 56</xref> A major outcome of these meetings was that the council strongly felt that the diet component of the intervention would be rendered obsolete in the Scottish preschool setting due to nearly all local authority preschools prohibiting children consuming &#x02018;junk food&#x02019; or sugar-sweetened beverages on the premises. This was discussed in a workshop with early years practitioners, who confirmed that only healthy snacks, water and milk were permitted in their preschools. However, the practitioners believed that eating, snacking and water consumption needed to be addressed in the home environment. Practitioners were less certain about the levels of PA and SB in preschools. Some believed that children were &#x02018;always on the move&#x02019;, and that PA was not an issue in Scottish preschools, while others thought more could be done to keep children active. Again, there was a consensus that both behaviours were major issues at home. In order to gain more insight into this, a small needs assessment study was conducted (results unpublished) which involved a sample of 15 preschoolers wearing an ActivPAL accelerometer for three consecutive days while at preschool and at home to measure PA and SB. The findings suggest&#x000a0;that considerable periods of inactivity exist both at preschool and at home, which is in line with recent research on SB and PA levels in preschoolers.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 21</xref> This highlights the need to address these behaviours in early childhood as noted by the 2016 WHO commission report on ending childhood obesity<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> and the newly&#x000a0;published 24&#x02009;hours movement guidelines.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Nursery visits were also conducted in four preschools across Glasgow to observe children&#x02019;s PA and SB. While outdoors, children were generally active, however in the classroom, activity levels varied. A number of opportunities to reduce SB by making changes to the classroom environment were identified.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>Involving stakeholders in the development and adaptation of interventions is a crucial step in ensuring a programme is acceptable and practical for those who will be responsible for delivering it.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> It was therefore deemed necessary to involve preschool staff in the development and adaptation of ToyBox-Scotland, and a seventh preschool was recruited to assist with intervention adaptation following the principles of coproduction,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> before the cluster RCT was undertaken in the other six preschools. An experienced early years practitioner from this preschool assisted by reviewing all of the classroom guides from the original ToyBox intervention, trialling out each activity with the children, and matching the ToyBox-Scotland programme with the Scottish preschool education curriculum. A number of meetings were held with the early years practitioner during this period, and together with the research team, a number of changes to the classroom guides and materials were agreed on. One of the main changes was to ensure the included activities were child&#x000a0;led, rather than practitioner&#x000a0;led, which is in keeping with the curriculum of preschool education in Scotland. Child-led learning in the context of the Scottish curriculum ensures that children are given the freedom to interact with learning tasks and materials with minimal adult direction.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Therefore, activities which did not allow for this were either removed or adapted. Out of 26 PA sessions from the original ToyBox-study, 11 were selected as they offered the most opportunities for child-led learning while still engaging with the PA elements. These were also the activities that the children found easiest to engage with, reflecting the younger age of Scottish preschool children compared with children from other European countries.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> The selected activities were also included as they were the most likely to encourage MVPA as opposed to lower intensity PA throughout the session. The SB activities (consisting of &#x02018;movement breaks&#x02019;, &#x02018;movement corners&#x02019; and classroom activities) were also trialled out. A number of the more cognitively/physically complex movement breaks and classroom activities were removed following recommendations from early years practitioners as the activities tended to break down or children would lose focus during delivery.

During baseline data collection, these questionnaires will also contain relevant questions relating to demographics. The questionnaires were developed for use in the original ToyBox-study and have been adapted for ToyBox-Scotland.

The researcher will assess if the delivered sessions match the instructions provided in the classroom guides. Specifically, details on the duration of the sessions, proportion of children who participate, intensity of PA sessions and practitioner instruction/engagement will be recorded. Practitioners will complete logbooks which will detail which specific sessions/activities were delivered each week and note any issues.</p><p>Intervention acceptability-preschool component:&#x000a0;Semistructured interviews will be conducted at the preschools with a sample of early years practitioners who deliver the intervention. Interviews will primarily focus on the barriers and facilitators to delivery and identify any areas for improvement in the event that a full-scale trial is implemented. Practitioners will also be asked to complete a pre and postintervention questionnaire, which along with interview and logbook data will be used for data triangulation.</p><p>Intervention fidelity-home component:&#x000a0;Practitioners will document the proportion of eligible children who are given home material packs and who take them home from the preschool. End of intervention feedback questionnaires will be provided to parents in the final homework packs. The questionnaires will seek to determine the level of engagement with each block of materials, parental perceptions of the homework tasks/materials and perceived changes to behaviour or enhanced knowledge as a result of the homework tasks/intervention materials.</p><p>Intervention acceptability-home component:&#x000a0;In addition to the end of study questionnaire, a sample of parents will also participate in a semi-structured interview to gain an in-depth understanding of their views and experiences of engaging with the intervention materials. Interview topics will mainly focus on parent/child perceptions, barriers/facilitators to participation and ways in which the content or delivery of the materials can be improved on. Interviews will be conducted either at the preschool or by telephone. This information will be used to inform further adaptations of the home component of the intervention.

Therefore, no sample size calculation was undertaken for this study, and the inclusion of six preschools is unlikely to be sufficient for any definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding the intervention&#x02019;s effect on health and behaviour outcomes. Rather, the sample will be sufficient to measure important feasibility parameters in a sample of preschools that are representative of the Glasgow City preschool environment.

Summary statistics will be applied to the outcome measures, with results presented as means (&#x000b1;SD), and where appropriate ORs (95% CI). Level of significance will be set at 0.05. Subgroup analysis will be performed to determine differences in recruitment and retention rates by socioeconomic status and direction of intervention effects by socioeconomic status, sex and weight status. However, due to the small sample size anticipated, these analyses will be exploratory in nature, and will be used to inform a future trial rather than to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the intervention. Participants who drop out will also be compared with those who complete the study, to determine if any significant differences exist. Data analysis will be conducted using IBM SPSS&#x000a0;v25 statistical analysis software.</p><p>Interview data will be transcribed verbatim prior to thematic analysis.

The original ToyBox-study successfully improved key energy balance-related behaviours among European preschool children,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and has now been adapted for use in the Scottish preschool setting. By using a coproduction approach to adapt the programme, it is hoped that the intervention will be more culturally relevant and user-friendly for the practitioners who will be responsible for its delivery. Considerable adaptation has also been applied to the home component of the intervention in an effort to increase parental engagement. Adapting successful interventions for use in other settings is becoming an increasingly common practice in child health research.<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> However, for success to translate from one setting to the other, adequate context-specific adaptations must be made to ensure the intervention can function as intended and still meets its desired aims.<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> The study outlined in this protocol aims to test whether the ToyBox-Scotland obesity prevention intervention is feasible and acceptable in the Scottish preschool and home setting, and to determine whether progression to a full-scale cluster RCT is recommended.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Trial status</title><p>Study status as of 10/04/2018: Ethical approval has been granted for the study.
