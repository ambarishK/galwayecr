Abstract</div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p>Many unhealthy dietary and physical activity habits that foster the development of obesity are established by the age of five. Presently, approximately 70 percent of children in the United States are currently enrolled in early childcare facilities, making this an ideal setting to implement and evaluate childhood obesity prevention efforts. We describe here the methods for conducting an obesity prevention randomized trial in the child care setting. </p> </div> <div class="methods/design" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods/design</div> <p>A randomized, controlled obesity prevention trial is currently being conducted over a three year period (2010-present). The sample consists of 28 low-income, ethnically diverse child care centers with 1105 children (sample is 60% Hispanic, 15% Haitian, 12% Black, 2% non-Hispanic White and 71% of caregivers were born outside of the US). The purpose is to test the efficacy of a parent and teacher role-modeling intervention on children’s nutrition and physical activity behaviors. . The Healthy Caregivers-Healthy Children (HC2) intervention arm schools received a combination of (1) implementing a daily curricula for teachers/parents (the nutritional gatekeepers); (2) implementing a daily curricula for children; (3) technical assistance with meal and snack menu modifications such as including more fresh and less canned produce; and (4) creation of a center policy for dietary requirements for meals and snacks, physical activity and screen time. Control arm schools received an attention control safety curriculum. Major outcome measures include pre-post changes in child body mass index percentile and z score, fruit and vegetable and other nutritious food intake, amount of physical activity, and parental nutrition and physical activity knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs, defined by intentions and behaviors. All measures were administered at the beginning and end of the school year for year one and year two of the study for a total of 4 longitudinal time points for assessment. </p> </div> <div class="discussion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussion</div> <p>Although few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life, this period may represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention. Findings from this investigation will inform both the fields of childhood obesity prevention and early childhood research about the effects of an obesity prevention program housed in the childcare setting. </p> </div> <div class="trialregistration" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p>One in four US children under age five is either overweight (≥85 <sup>th</sup> to &amp;lt;95 <sup>th</sup> percentile for age- and sex-adjusted percentiles for body mass index [BMI]) or obese (≥95 <sup>th</sup> percentile age- and sex-adjusted percentiles for BMI), with ethnic minority groups being disproportionately affected [ <a href="#B1">1</a>, <a href="#B2">2</a>]. These statistics are of particular concern because obese preschool-aged children are five times more likely to be overweight during adolescence [ <a href="#B3">3</a>] and more than four times as likely to be obese adults when compared to their normal weight counterparts [ <a href="#B3">3</a>, <a href="#B4">4</a>]. These results show that contrary to popular belief, children do not "grow out of" their "baby fat." In fact, evidence indicates that excessive weight gain in the first years of life can alter developing neural, metabolic and behavioral systems in ways that increase the risk for obesity and chronic disease later in life [ <a href="#B5">5</a>, <a href="#B6">6</a>]. Specifically, childhood obesity is a precursor to type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, osteoarthritis, asthma, and certain cancers [ <a href="#B5">5</a>, <a href="#B6">6</a>]. As such, many reports have projected that childhood-onset obesity will contribute significantly to increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood [ <a href="#B7">7</a>], particularly among ethnic minority groups who are disproportionately affected by many of these chronic conditions [ <a href="#B8">8</a>]. </p> <p>Although few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life, this period may represent <i>the</i> best opportunity for obesity prevention. During infancy and early childhood lifestyle behaviors that promote obesity are just being learned, and it is easier to establish new behaviors than to change existing ones. Furthermore, childcare settings offer a potentially very powerful opportunity to implement such efforts because; (1) 70% of preschool-aged children in our nation are enrolled in daily, out-of-home child care [ <a href="#B9">9</a>]; (2) children from low-income backgrounds consume 50%-100% of their Recommended Dietary Allowances (according to standards established by the Child Care Food Program) in the childcare setting; (3) many children spend the majority of their waking hours out-of-home, and in the childcare setting [ <a href="#B10">10</a>]. </p> <p>The majority of the childcare setting studies conducted to date focus on individual-level interventions [ <a href="#B11">11</a>- <a href="#B14">14</a>] with few efforts targeting systemic policy-level changes that include evidence-based curricula and modifications to institutionally-provided meals and snacks. In fact, health and nutrition are often completely overlooked in the childcare setting because administrators and teachers feel they are under-qualified to deliver this information [ <a href="#B15">15</a>]. Additionally, many adults make food choices (purchasing and consumption) couched in personal attitudes and beliefs about food and nutrition, which in turn influence children’s nutritional beliefs, attitudes and behaviors [ <a href="#B16">16</a>, <a href="#B17">17</a>]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) concept of the "nutritional gatekeeper" and the "Project M. O. M. : Mother’s &amp;amp; Others &amp;amp; My Pyramid" campaign [ <a href="#B18">18</a>] suggests that empowering the nutritional gatekeepers in both the home and the child care center will potentiate a lasting and effective impact on the health and nutrition of future adults. For example, using a similar model in the elementary school setting "nutrition education extenders" were found to have a positive effect on child nutrition practices during and after the Healthier Options for Public Schoolchildren (HOPS) Study [ <a href="#B19">19</a>, <a href="#B20">20</a>]. </p> <p>We describe here the research design and methods for a federally-funded, large-scale comprehensive obesity prevention intervention randomized controlled trial "Healthy Caregivers, Healthy Children HC2" to test (1) the utility of teachers and parents as effective nutritional gatekeeper role models, or change agents; and (2) the efficacy of center-based nutrition and physical activity policies, and how both affect early childhood growth patterns (namely body mass index), nutrition and physical activity practices among preschool-age children. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p>A randomized, controlled obesity prevention trial in 28 low-income, ethnically diverse child care centers located throughout Miami-Dade County, FL is currently being conducted over two years (2010-present) to test the efficacy of an intervention that poises teachers and parents as lifestyle change agents. Trial methodology, intervention content and outcome measures are described in detail below. </p> <div class="studydesign" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Study design</div> <p>Because it was not feasible to randomize individuals within classrooms to different treatments, we randomly assigned centers to treatment or control conditions. Thus, HC2 is a group-randomized study, often referred to as a <i>cluster</i> randomized trial (CRT). In CRTs, clusters of people, or intact social units (such as childcare centers) rather than individuals are randomized to intervention and control groups and outcomes are measured on individuals within those clusters. CRT designs are used not only to evaluate group interventions but also individual interventions where group level effects are relevant. The University of Miami Institutional Review Board approved all aspects of the study. </p> </div> <div class="inclusioncriteria" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Inclusion criteria</div> <p>Centers must have met the following criteria to be included in the study: (1) &amp;gt; 30 children ages 2-to-5 currently enrolled; (2) Serve low income families who are a part of the USDA food program and SNAP eligible; (3) Reflect the ethnic distribution of the Miami-Dade County Public School System (63 percent Hispanic, 19 percent African American, 18 percent white); and (4) Center director agrees to participate and sign a letter of commitment. Centers were excluded if they did not meet these criteria. </p> </div> <div class="studyparticipants" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Study participants</div> <p>Parents consented to have their child participate in the study.

Intervention arm</div> <p>Treatment or intervention arm schools received a combination of (1) implementing a daily curricula for teachers/parents (the nutritional gatekeepers); (2) implementing a daily curricula for children; (3) technical assistance with meal and snack menu modifications such as including more fresh and less canned produce, no high fat milk, and less simple carbohydrate items; and (4) creation of a center policy for dietary requirements for meals and snacks, physical activity and screen time. Details of each of these components follows. </p> </div> <div class="teacher/parentnutritionalgatekeepercurriculum" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Teacher/parent nutritional gatekeeper curriculum</div> <p>For childhood obesity prevention programs to achieve long-term success the nutritional gatekeeper (i.e. the person buying and supplying food for the children) must engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors and beliefs themselves. For young children the nutritional gatekeeper is most likely the parent or a primary caregiver and for those who attend childcare, the teachers and center staff also. Therefore, Curriculum Specialist (CS) utilized an integrated curriculum with teachers and parents at the child care centers. The teacher-focused curriculum consisted of 29 weekly technical assistance sessions delivered by HC2 curriculum specialists during weekly visits to the childcare centers. Additionally, HC2 program staff conducted joint parent-teacher meetings (providing a substitute so that teachers can attend during parent pickup times) that focused on an evidence-based nutrition and physical activity curriculum. CS taught parents and teachers about (1) Choosing healthy foods, with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables; (2) Making healthy food choices for infant and child development; (3) Preparing nutritious snacks; (4) Preparing new recipes; (5) Tasting new foods; (6) Learning about food safety and storage; (7) Planning meals; (8) Making grocery lists; (9) Shopping wisely for groceries; (10) Budgeting food dollars and food stamps; and, (11) Using food labels to choose best buys. Via role-modeling, parents and teachers were encouraged to implement change at the family/home and child care center level, not child level. Additionally, nutritional professionals served as role models for the teachers and parents and assisted them as nutritional gatekeepers and positive models for the children. Lessons on physical activity for the whole family were also included (Table <a href="#T3">3</a>). </p> <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 3</span>  <p>Nutritional gatekeeper role modeling curriculum lessons, objectives and activities for childcare center teachers and parents </p>  <table> <div class="colgroup_UNKNOWN"> <div class="col_UNKNOWN" /></div> <div class="colgroup_UNKNOWN"><div class="col_UNKNOWN" /></div> <div class="colgroup_UNKNOWN"><div class="col_UNKNOWN" /></div>  <thead> <tr> <th> <b>Lesson</b> </th> <th> <b>Objectives, To Learn:</b> </th> <th> <b>Activities</b> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> <b>Lesson 1:</b> If you are active, your child will be active. <hr /> </td> <td>· the benefits of being an active caregiver and child <hr /> </td> <td>Caregivers fill out the "Together We Can" weekly Caregiver and child activity chart <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· the right conditions for your child to have the best time while exercising with you <hr /> </td> <td>Find local and inexpensive physical activities in the area that families can do together <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· the "Three Elements of Physical Fitness" in action in the playground <hr /> </td> <td> <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· physical activities that strive for endurance, strength, and flexibility that can be done with your child <hr /> </td> <td>Perform endurance, strength, and flexibility exercises with caregivers <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· how to be a good example for your child <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· why physical activity is important for you and your child <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· how much physical fitness your child needs <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <b>Lesson 2:</b> Empowerment and problem solving : Staying active and having a positive body image <hr /> </td> <td>· Fun exercises you can do with your child <hr /> </td> <td>Caregivers will take the "Healthy Body Survey" and discuss the results <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· What body image is and how you can develop a better one <hr /> </td> <td> <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· How to become a healthy eater <hr /> </td> <td> <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· How to determine if you have a healthy relationship with food and fitness <hr /> </td> <td>Discuss and perform activities that keep caregivers and children active at home <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <b>Lesson 3:</b> If you eat healthy foods, your child will eat healthy foods <hr /> </td> <td>· How to get kids to chose what they like to eat <hr /> </td> <td>Prepare a kid-friendly fruit and veggie party and taste the goodies <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· The benefits of taking kids to the grocery store <hr /> </td> <td> <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· The benefits of cooking with your kids <hr /> </td> <td>Demonstrate how children can take part in cooking a healthy, easy and quick meal at home. <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· How to get kids to try new foods <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· Tips on fighting obesity <hr /> </td> <td> <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· Fun ideas for healthy eaters <hr /> </td> <td> <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· How much to feed your child <hr /> </td> <td> <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· Eating safety tips <hr /> </td> <td>Show healthy portion sizes for preschoolers <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <b>Lesson 4:</b> Empowerment and Problem Solving: Staying active </td> <td>Tips on how to have a fit child <hr /> </td> <td>Perform yoga exercises for caregivers and children <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· Tips on fighting obesity and staying active <hr /> </td> <td> <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· How to help children learn new skills while going for a walk <hr /> </td> <td>Play fun, active games that can be played at home</td> </tr> <tr> <td>· What preschool children should be able to do <hr /> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>· When you should call a doctor</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>Our framework was comprised of a variety of role modeling components from the USDA’s Project M.O.M [ <a href="#B18">18</a>, <a href="#B21">21</a>- <a href="#B24">24</a>].

Univariate/Bivariate</div> <p>Our univariate analysis consists of simple descriptive measures such as percentages, medians, ranges, variances, and standard deviations to describe all study participants and sites. Bivariate analysis is used to explore possible confounding variables such as age, gender and ethnicity via simple contingency table analysis and ANOVA. Pearson product moment correlation coefficient matrixes investigate the relationships (either positive or negative) in the percent change in BMI and all predictor variables. We pool data within-cells to account for our randomized group study design that essentially blocks at the center level (PROC DISCRIM procedure in the SAS statistical package). <b> <i>Multivariate</i> </b> <b>.</b> Repeated measures linear regression models are used to determine patterns of progression or improvement in BMI percentile over time, as well as to identify demographic and family characteristics associated with BMI outcomes. Repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) determines the relationships between BMI and our environmental and family modification (via the theoretical constructs) covariates. ANCOVA is used to increase power in a one-way or two-way ANOVA by adding a second or third variable as a covariate. ANCOVA was an attractive higher level method of analysis for our design because it is capable of removing the obscuring effects of pre-existing individual differences among subjects while also allowing for compensation for systematic biases among our samples. <b>Cost Analysis</b>. Resource use and cost data for the intervention are being collected across all intervention centers. Key statistics from the cost evaluation will include total annual economic cost for the intervention and weekly economic cost per child. </p> </div> </div> <div class="discussion" title="discussion"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussion</div> <p> <i>Healthy People 2020</i>[ <a href="#B37">37</a>] identifies "Nutrition and Weight Status" as one of their major objectives to "promote health and reduce chronic disease risk through the consumption of healthful diets and achievement and maintenance of healthy body weights." This objective emphasizes that efforts to change diet and weight should address the policies and environments that support these behaviors in settings such as schools [ <a href="#B37">37</a>]. Although few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life, this period may represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention. Findings from this investigation should inform both the fields of childhood obesity prevention and early childhood research about the effects of an obesity prevention program housed in the childcare setting. As childhood obesity continues to be a topic of national interest is in the best interest of health care providers, educators, and parents to begin thinking about this as a priority for ensuring the healthy future of our community’s children. </p> <p>The Institute of Medicine’s (IOM’s) Standing Committee on Childhood Obesity Prevention recently commenced a study to examine the evidence and provide guidance on obesity prevention policies for children ages birth to five years old. Based on this study’s findings, in 2011 this committee created a set of policy recommendations designed specifically to prevent obesity in early childhood by promoting healthy early environments in settings outside the home where young children spend substantial time, namely childcare settings in particular [ <a href="#B38">38</a>]. Recommendations were formulated using the best evidence available, including both direct (published literature, organizational reports) and indirect (expert input) data about the likely impact of a given policy on reducing childhood obesity. The committee’s overreaching goal was to have the report "find its way to federal, state and local government policy makers who work in areas that impact young children." However, they acknowledge that "it will be important to act today based on what is known, while also undertaking the necessary research and policy evaluation to ensure better informed and effective actions in the future." To date, the concept that incorporating these policies in the childcare setting will result in reduced obesity rates, increased access to nutritious foods, increased physical activity and decreased inactivity has been largely based on conjecture, not on scientific evidence produced by adequately controlled trials, making this study all the more timely. </p> </div> <div class="limitationsandstrengthsofstudydesign" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Limitations and strengths of study design</div> <p>We are limited in our ability to generalize our research findings to children who are older than 5 years and to families that are not from low income backgrounds. Strengths of the study include the design, as randomized controlled trials are considered the "gold standard" in terms of design rigor and ethnic diversity of the sample. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="conclusions"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
