The clinics were managed under one medical facility and provided primary care services. Questions targeted medical providers including physicians and nurse practitioners. The interview guide was developed specifically for this project. The guide was reviewed by a physician and a registered dietitian (RD) from an on-site Obesity Management Team representing the three clinics (<xref rid="table1-2050312119834117" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Feedback from the physician and RD was used, and the wordings of some questions were modified to appropriately target questions. The Obesity Management physician and RD provided a list of medical providers, and recruitment was conducted by a research assistant on site during clinic hours. Interviews were conducted by the first author (L.R.S.) who at the time was a research assistant (Master&#x02019;s student) to the last author (L.H.) (both female), with L.H. a nutrition faculty member holding a doctorate. The research assistant conducting the interviews was trained by the principal investigator (PI) and had also conducted a prior literature review on qualitative methodology to prepare for the study. Recruitment continued until a majority of eligible personnel had been invited to participate. All medical staff approached for interviews agreed to participate, and recruitment and interviews continued until saturation of themes was identified. Participants were invited via email or phone to participate in the interviews (contact information provided by Obesity Management Team at the clinics). Incentives were not used in this study. The research assistant who conducted the interviews did not have a prior established relationship with the participants. The participants were aware of the study focus to examine weight management practices at the clinic. Although the research assistant who conducted the interviews is currently an RD, this training and credentialing did not occur until after the study concluded (conclusion of data collection and analysis). Data analysis and results were also reviewed by the third author (K.J.G.) who has expertise in pediatric obesity but is not a nutrition faculty or RD. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, and content analysis was performed to determine themes. The study was approved by the institutional review board at the principal investigator&#x02019;s university. Informed consent was obtained prior to all interviews.</p><table-wrap id="table1-2050312119834117" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Medical providers interview guide.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312119834117-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.

Parents are perceived as the primary barrier in weight management discussions. Primary factors affecting this communication include parental weight (overweight), lack of agreement regarding weight and health status, and lack of recognition by parents of what are &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; foods and serving sizes. Parental perceptions of their child&#x02019;s weight status are well-supported in the literature, especially in minority groups represented at this clinic.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="bibr26-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr27-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr28-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr30-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr31-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr32-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr33-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Parents in many cultural groups, particularly Hispanic and African American as well as other groups, do not always perceive excess weight as problematic.

Furthermore, cultural context and perceptions with food, weight, and body image supports the need for health care providers to provide culturally relevant information and use culturally sensitive strategies to promote lifestyle changes. Tailored, targeted nutrition education has been found to be the most effective at supporting behavior change, which is necessary to address obesity.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="bibr37-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr38-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>Although parents were identified as a barrier, they were also believed to be the most influential factor in pediatric weight management.

Avoidance of nutrition advice is a clear barrier for successful weight management as both energy intake and energy expenditure are key components to managing weight. Providers in this study reported difficulty with providing nutrition advice, which is concerning because of the hesitancy or avoidance of nutrition education for patients by providers. Yarborough et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> also found that providers reported a lack of confidence regarding nutrition advice. However, in order to meet recommended guidelines for the prevention, management, and treatment of pediatric obesity nutrition must be included in weight management counseling. Improved nutrition training for medical providers has been suggested and could possibly improve prevention, management, and treatment of pediatric obesity.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="bibr37-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr38-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Moreover, improvement of self-efficacy and delivery of nutrition education may meet parental needs and foster a positive patient&#x02013;provider relationship. For example, there is evidence of parental preferences for individualized nutrition information. In a study by Lupi et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2050312119834117" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> parents reported interest in receiving weekly meal and nutritional plans from their providers.</p><p>RDs are uniquely qualified to help patients with obesity because of their extensive nutrition training and knowledge.

Children had a decreased BMI and waist circumference, and their results lasted longer than those receiving usual care. Furthermore, the specific training of dietitians makes them a strong potential health care team in combating the current pediatric obesity epidemic and they may be able to assist in relieving the high burden of obesity prevention, management, and treatment.</p><p>Findings from this study explore the experiences of medical providers in weight counseling and management.

Due to the time constraints and potential stress level of interviewing during working hours, some feedback may not have been as detailed, or as extensive as desired, although interviews which were shorter usually included participant responses that were brief. Theme saturation was reached during interviews however, the sample size was small. The interview guide used in this study was developed specifically for this project and was not pilot tested prior to this study. Validation primarily focused on face validation from members of the clinic&#x02019;s Obesity Management Team (which included a physician and an RD). This study investigated perceptions of providers working with a very specific audience at an urban, diverse, low-income pediatric community clinic, and results may not be applicable to other clinical settings; however, disparities and limited research with these patients support the need to examine practices with these groups. Findings were also self-reported experiences and perceptions which have potential for subjective bias. Despite efforts for quality control in the interpretation and analysis of interview transcriptions, there is potential for un-intended bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section18-2050312119834117"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study suggest that successful management of children&#x02019;s weight likely involves addressing the issue at two levels: the parent and the provider. At the parent level, this requires that parents understand the risks that being overweight can have on their children&#x02019;s health and development and that they have a critical role in helping their children manage their weight and general health. At the provider level, the challenge is more complex because it requires health professionals to discuss with parents their child&#x02019;s nutrition, physical activity levels, sleep patterns, and existing medical conditions and to formulate an individualized or tailored plan for the parent and the child. To achieve success at both levels, open efforts to understand and work together for the common benefit of the child are essential. The results from this study suggest better resources (or training) for primary care providers are needed to support provision of sound and effective nutrition advice. The consistent reporting of time as a major barrier in combination with the above challenges suggests the potential benefit of incorporating dietitians into primary care to assist primary care providers (e.g. physicians and pediatricians) and may be a viable complementary practice in preventing, managing, and treating pediatric obesity. The relatively poor progress made toward preventing, managing, and treating pediatric obesity in our society clearly indicates that new approaches and/or utilization of new resources or collaborations are needed. A good first step would be to enhance pediatric practitioner&#x02019;s ability to address children with excess weight and/or obesity and to teach parents the importance of good nutrition, physical activity, adequate sleep, and staying informed and engaged with their children&#x02019;s health and development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section19-2050312119834117" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="suppl1-2050312119834117"><caption><title>COREQ_checklist &#x02013; Supplemental material for A qualitative study examining medical provider advice, barriers, and perceived effectiveness in addressing childhood obesity to patients and families from a low-income community health clinic</title></caption><media xlink:href="COREQ_checklist.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>Supplemental material, COREQ_checklist for A qualitative study examining medical provider advice, barriers, and perceived effectiveness in addressing childhood obesity to patients and families from a low-income community health clinic by Lauren R Sastre, Stephanie Matson, Kenneth J Gruber and Lauren Haldeman in SAGE Open Medicine</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the medical providers at the clinics for their time in participating in the study interviews.
