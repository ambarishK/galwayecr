    "Objective:To examine medical provider (n = 16) perceptions in addressing and managing pediatric obesity with a diverse, low-income patient population. Methods:Semi-structured audio-recorded interviews were performed at three pediatric clinics. Transcripts were reviewed using content analysis and consensus was reached among authors for themes. Themes were grouped into categories including: (1) initiation of weight discussions, (2) advice and perceived effectiveness, and (3) barriers. Results:Most providers reported being comfortable addressing weight and use a variety of methods to initiate conversations; however, many challenges were reported, which include limited time and parent misperceptions of child's weight. A broad range of lifestyle advice was utilized, but preference to discuss physical activity over nutrition was reported. Conclusion:Results suggest that successful management of children's weight involves addressing issues at both the parent and the provider levels. Improved nutrition resources or training for providers is suggested; however, time must also be available for individualized counseling. Incorporation of registered dietitians may also reduce the burden."
