Abstract</div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p>There is some evidence that school-based interventions are effective in preventing childhood obesity. However, longer term outcomes, equity of effects and cost-effectiveness of interventions have not been assessed. </p> <p>The aim of this trial is to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention programme targeting the school and family environment through primary schools, in preventing obesity in 6â€“7 year old children, compared to usual practice. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p>This cluster randomised controlled trial is set in 54 primary schools within the West Midlands, UK, including a multi-ethnic, socioeconomically diverse population of children aged 6â€“7 years. </p> <p>The 12-month intervention consists of healthy diet and physical activity promotion. These include: activities to increase time spent doing physical activity within the school day, participation in the â€˜Villa Vitalityâ€™ programme (a programme that is delivered by an iconic sporting institution (Aston Villa Football Club), which provides interactive learning opportunities for physical activity and healthy eating), healthy cooking skills workshops in school time for parents and children, and provision of information to families signposting local leisure opportunities. The primary (clinical) outcome is the difference in body mass index (BMI) z-scores between arms at 3 and 18 months post-intervention completion. Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) will also be assessed. The sample size estimate (1000 children split across 50 schools at follow-up) is based on 90% power to detect differences in BMI z-score of 0.25 (estimated ICC â‰¤ 0.04), assuming a correlation between baseline and follow-up BMI z-score of 0.9. Treatment effects will be examined using mixed model ANCOVA. Primary analysis will adjust for baseline BMI z-score, and secondary analysis will adjust for pre-specified baseline school and child level covariates. </p> </div> <div class="discussion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussion</div> <p>The West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children (WAVES) study is the first trial that will examine the cost-effectiveness and long term outcomes of a childhood obesity prevention programme in a multi-ethnic population, with a sufficient sample size to detect clinically important differences in adiposity. The intervention was developed using the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions, and outcomes are measured objectively, together with a comprehensive process evaluation. </p> </div> <div class="trialregistration" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p>Childhood overweight and obesity is an ever increasing public health concern [ <a href="#CR1">1</a>] which has serious health consequences in both child [ <a href="#CR2">2</a>] and adult life [ <a href="#CR3">3</a>]. Children as young as 7 years old, who are obese, are at higher risk of premature mortality in adulthood, compared to their normal weight counterparts [ <a href="#CR4">4</a>] and from the age of 11 years, there is tracking of behaviours [ <a href="#CR5">5</a>], such that over 50% of obese children become obese adults [ <a href="#CR6">6</a>]. In England childhood obesity rates have increased over the last 20 years. A doubling of prevalence of obesity can be observed between the ages of 4 and 11 years (the primary school years) [ <a href="#CR7">7</a>]. This is the time period of adiposity rebound, which occurs following a nadir in Body Mass Index (BMI) around the age of 5â€“6 years [ <a href="#CR8">8</a>]. Thus the primary school years are a key time period for targeting interventions for the prevention of childhood obesity. In terms of settings, schools are an environment in which the majority of children spend a sustained period of time. They provide an infrastructure through which children and their parents can be identified and receive, both within and outside the curriculum, opportunities to learn about, practice and reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviours. </p> <p>Several systematic reviews [ <a href="#CR9">9</a>- <a href="#CR11">11</a>] have summarised the outcomes of previous childhood obesity prevention studies, undertaken in a variety of settings including school, community and family. The most up-to-date Cochrane review of trials, published in 2011, showed that school based interventions, particularly those targeting 6â€“12 year olds, are effective in reducing adiposity (mean effect size âˆ’0.15 for BMI z-score). However, there was much heterogeneity in intervention components and design and generally small sample sizes. Furthermore previous trials were poor at reporting process and implementation measures, rarely considered equity of effects in relation to sex, ethnicity or other subgroups, tended not to report longer term outcomes and seldom reported on adverse effects or costs. </p> <div class="developmentofachildhoodobesitypreventionprogramme" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Development of a childhood obesity prevention programme</div> <p>The Birmingham healthy Eating and Active lifestyle for CHildren Study (BEACHeS) was funded by the UK National Prevention Research Initiative and took place from 2006 to 2009. The study used the early phases of the UK Medical Council Research framework for complex intervention development and evaluation [ <a href="#CR12">12</a>] to develop a childhood obesity prevention programme aimed at children aged 6â€“8 years, and tested its feasibility and acceptability in an exploratory trial. A number of different methodologies were employed and iteratively combined in the theoretical and modelling phases of intervention development [ <a href="#CR13">13</a>]. These included a review of childhood obesity prevention evidence, focus groups with key stakeholders to explore their views of the causes of childhood obesity [ <a href="#CR14">14</a>] and their perceptions of preventive approaches, consultation with a group of professionals, and a review of existing local resources and national policy. The Analysis Grid for Environments Linked to Obesity (ANGELO framework) [ <a href="#CR15">15</a>] was applied during the development process to ensure the intervention addressed all relevant environmental dimensions. The initial programme consisted of two broad strands: increasing childrenâ€™s physical activity levels through school, and family healthy behaviour skills (food preparation and physical activity) through activity based learning. The programme was tested and further refined through a feasibility study involving eight primary schools in Birmingham, UK [ <a href="#CR16">16</a>], which provided justification for a more definitive evaluation of the intervention. </p> <p>In this paper we describe the study protocol for the definitive evaluation (a cluster randomised controlled trial); the West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children (WAVES) study, funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme. </p> <div class="trialaimsandobjectives" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Trial aims and objectives</div> <p>The main aim is to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the 12-month childhood obesity prevention intervention programme, developed and refined in the BEACHeS study, using usual practice in primary schools as the comparator. Intervention effects will be examined at 3 and 18 months post-intervention completion. Cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed from a societal perspective. In addition, differences in intermediate and final outcomes will be explored by sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and weight status. We will also use a variety of methods to describe the implementation of, and adherence to, intervention components [ <a href="#CR17">17</a>]. </p> </div> <div class="trialdesignandoverview" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Trial design and overview</div> <p>The WAVES study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Primary schools (nâ€‰=â€‰54) are recruited from a multi-ethnic population within the West Midlands, UK. Randomization is at the level of the cluster (school). Data are collected at both the cluster (school) and within cluster (individual pupils and their parents) level. To test the effect of the intervention, a range of anthropometric and psychological data are collected (described in detail later) on children within participating schools. Baseline measures are undertaken when the participating children are in Year 1 (April to July; aged 5 to 6 years). Schools are then randomly allocated to either the usual practice or intervention arm. Schools in the intervention arm are asked to implement a 12 month, multifaceted intervention programme (details below) when children are in Year 2 (aged 6 to 7 years). The programme includes physical activity and dietary components, targeting the school and family environments and aims to help children maintain a healthy weight, thereby preventing overweight/obesity. Due to practical considerations, half the schools (Group 1) are recruited to commence the study in the 2011/12 school year and the remainder (Group 2) in the 2012/13 school year. First follow-up measures are undertaken immediately after the intervention year (September to December, when the children are in Year 3; aged 7 to 8 years) and second follow-up measures are undertaken 18 months post intervention (January to March, when the children are in Year 4; aged 8 to 9 years). Group 1 schools receive a third set of follow-up measures 27 months post intervention completion (September to December when in Year 5; aged 9 to 10 years). A summary of the study design and timelines is shown in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Study design and the flow of study participants through the WAVES study.</p>   </div> <p /> <p>NHS Research Ethics approval for the trial was obtained from the Black Country Research Ethics Committee (NHS REC no.10/H1202/69).

Methods</div> <div class="studysettingandparticipanteligibility" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Study setting and participant eligibility</div> <p>All state primary schools in the West Midlands (UK) which included school years 1 to 5 (children aged 5 to 10 years) and that were within a 35 mile radius of the University of Birmingham were eligible for inclusion (nâ€‰=â€‰980). To ensure sufficient representation in the sample to enable sub-group analysis by minority ethnic group, school populations were stratified by ethnic mix including White, South Asian (comprising Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani) and Black (including African and Caribbean), with the remainder being classified as "Other" ethnicity. School populations were dichotomised as being in the top 80th percentile in terms of South Asian or Black pupil representation, or not. The sampling strategy used a weighted random sample so that schools with a higher minority ethnic population (in top 80th percentile for South Asian or Black) had an increased chance of being sampled with a ratio of 3:1. Given the relatively large number of clusters (&amp;gt;50) the sampling strategy was also balanced to take account of three other important factors to ensure a range of characteristics are represented. These were: proportion of children eligible for free school meals (FSM) as an indicator of socio-economic make-up of the pupils, school size and urban/rural location of the school. Using this method, 200 schools were selected and ordered using a random number generator. Of these, 7 were excluded as they did not fit the eligibility criteria. The remaining schools were sequentially invited to participate, and 148 were approached until the required sample size (54 schools) was achieved. Of the 148 schools approached, 4 did not respond and 90 declined to participate. </p> </div> <div class="exclusioncriteria" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Exclusion criteria</div> <p>Schools with fewer than 17 pupils in the relevant year group (minimum cluster size), or those that were in special measures (status applied by the Office for Standards in Education when it considers that a school fails to supply an acceptable level of education and appears to lack the leadership capacity necessary to secure improvements) were excluded. </p> </div> <div class="schoolrecruitmentprocess" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
School recruitment process</div> <p>Schools were approached by letter, followed by a phone call and a visit to interested schools. All participating schools (control and intervention) receive a financial reimbursement (Â£190) following each period of pupil measurement to compensate for staff time spent on the study. Regular newsletters are sent to participating schools to maintain engagement. </p> </div> <div class="recruitmentofstudyparticipants" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Recruitment of study participants</div> <p>All Year 1 pupils (aged 5 to 6 years) in participating schools were eligible to take part.

Trial intervention</div> <p>The WAVES study intervention programme has four components (outlined below) delivered over 12 months. There is also a termly family newsletter to reinforce the messages delivered through the various components. The schools are used as the platform for disseminating information, targeting intervention children and their families, and as the venue for some of the intervention components. Each component has fixed parameters as well as elements that allow tailoring to specific populations, enabling schools to adapt the delivery by taking account of local circumstances. Relevant school staff members are provided with a manual and a short training session on delivering the intervention. Follow-up support for intervention delivery is provided by research staff in the first few weeks. No further support is provided for the remaining intervention period. </p> <p>Schools in the intervention arm receive reimbursement (Â£380) to cover costs incurred through their involvement with the intervention (such as staff cover for teacher training). </p> <div class="component1:structuredphysicalactivityopportunitiesduringtheschoolday" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Component 1: Structured physical activity opportunities during the school day</div> <p>The overall aim of this component is to increase physical activity opportunities within the school day, with a target for children to achieve an additional 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day. Teachers can select two from a choice of four activity programmes which are available in the UK market; â€˜Activateâ€™ [ <a href="#CR18">18</a>], â€˜Positive Playâ€™ [ <a href="#CR19">19</a>], â€˜Take 10â€™ [ <a href="#CR20">20</a>] or â€˜Wake Up Shake Upâ€™ [ <a href="#CR21">21</a>]. These programmes were selected as they could be tailored to each school setting and incorporate a range of classroom and playground based routines to help children be active in a school environment with minimal disruption to the regular school day. </p> </div> <div class="component2:cookingskillsworkshopsforchildrenandparents" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Component 2: Cooking skills workshops for children and parents</div> <p>The aim of this component is to increase healthy eating knowledge and improve food preparation skills of parents and children. A series of three workshops, designed by research nutritionists for children and their parents or carers, is delivered by school staff. Each workshop was piloted (with 6 to 8 children aged 6â€“7 years and their parents) and the content and format modified as necessary prior to completion. Relevant school staff members are invited to attend interactive training on the content and delivery of the workshops, where they are provided with all relevant materials (including lesson plans and presentation slides) and participate in a practical session. The workshops, which are intended to be delivered once per term through the school year, focus on â€˜breakfastâ€™, â€˜lunch and snacksâ€™ and â€˜evening mealâ€™. Key messages are consistently included across all sessions to increase fruit, vegetable and fibre intakes, and decrease fat and sugar intakes. Each workshop is preceded by three 10 minute lessons for the children in class time to prepare them for the topics to be covered. During the workshop an interactive educational session is followed by practical food preparation, where children work with their parents to prepare healthy food that they can eat together. Written information emphasising key messages is given to parents and carers to take home after the workshops. </p> </div> <div class="component3:signposting" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Component 3: Signposting</div> <p>The aim of this component is to increase participation in physical activity out of school hours. Children are given two information sheets to take home, signposting opportunities and facilities for them and their family to be physically active. Following baseline measures, children in intervention schools are given a brightly coloured information sheet which highlights the UK government recommendation of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day [ <a href="#CR22">22</a>], and uses motivational statements (such as encouraging goal setting) as well as information and ideas for how children and their families could be active over the summer holidays. The focus is on everyday opportunities such as walking and physical activities that could be done in the home. At the beginning of the following term, they are given more specific information, which again highlights the 60 minutes of activity message, and gives details of clubs, leisure centres, parks and other opportunities suitable for families with young children to undertake physical activity within close proximity of their school. </p> </div> <div class="component4:villavitality" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Component 4: Villa Vitality</div> <p>The aim of this component is to promote healthy lifestyle messages through an iconic sports institution and its staff. Villa Vitality (VV) is a programme run at Aston Villa Football Club (AVFC; a premier league English football club), focusing on promoting healthy eating and physical activity through interactive sessions delivered at AVFC. The programme, originally designed for older children, has been adapted for the WAVES study by collaboration between VV staff and the research team. All the messages delivered as part of the programme are consistent with the other components of the WAVES study intervention. The revised programme was piloted with a sample of Year 2 children (nâ€‰=â€‰60) before implementation in the study intervention arm. </p> <p>The VV programme involves two day trips to AVFC, six weeks apart. The children participate in a range of activities during these days. These include: physical activity games and ball skills, two nutrition education sessions, dance mats, preparing a meal in the VV kitchen, a tour of the stadium and a session in the VV radio studio. During the intervening 6 weeks, the children are encouraged to participate in weekly health challenges (achieve 60 minutes of activity every day, swap a snack, drink more water, eat a healthy breakfast every day, eat 5 portions of fruit and veg every day and cook a healthy family meal), and undertake a class project (to produce a song, story or poem about healthy living for recording during their session in the VV radio studio). The children also receive a 60 minute physical activity session run at school by an Aston Villa Football Academy coach. During this visit the coach also reviews progress in relation to both the class project and the weekly challenges. </p> </div> </div> <div class="comparator" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Comparator</div> <p>Schools in the usual practice (control) arm are sent citizenship education resources [ <a href="#CR23">23</a>] to use as they wish (the topics of healthy eating and physical activity are intentionally avoided). No other active intervention is offered. These schools continue with any ongoing health related activities. </p> </div> <div class="methodofrandomallocationandblinding" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Method of random allocation and blinding</div> <p>A blocked balancing algorithm is used to randomise schools to either the intervention or control arm [ <a href="#CR24">24</a>, <a href="#CR25">25</a>]. This algorithm randomly selects one of a number of allocation designs which minimise the imbalance between covariate means. The covariates included are percentage of pupils within the school eligible for free school meals; percentage of South Asian pupils within the school; percentage of Black pupils within the school; percentage of White pupils within the school; and number of pupils within the school. Randomisation is undertaken after baseline measurements, and participating schools are then informed of allocation. </p> </div> <div class="outcomemeasures" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Outcome measures</div> <p>For clinical effectiveness, the primary outcome is the difference in body mass index (BMI) z-scores (using the UK 1990 BMI reference curves for children [ <a href="#CR26">26</a>]) between arms at 3- and 18-month follow-up post-intervention completion. Secondary outcomes include: i) anthropometric measures: percentage overweight and obese (defined as a BMI greater than the 85th percentile on the UK 1990 reference charts for BMI centiles for boys and girls), skinfold thickness at 5 sites (biceps, triceps, thigh, suprailiac and subscapular), waist circumference and percentage body fat; ii) blood pressure; iii) dietary energy (kJ per kg body weight per day), fat, sugar, fibre (g/day), and fruit and vegetable intake (g/day and portions); iv) physical activity energy expenditure (kJ per kg body weight per day), and time spent doing sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous intensity activity (min/day), v) psychosocial outcomes to assess the wider effects of the intervention, including benefits and potential harms: health related quality of life and body dissatisfaction, and vi) longer term clinical effectiveness at 27 months post intervention in Group 1 schools. </p> <p>For cost-effectiveness analysis, the primary outcome is cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Other analyses will include cost per effectiveness outcomes such as change in BMI z-score and change in proportion of overweight/obese. A longer term model-based evaluation will predict cost-per-QALY outcomes over a lifetime by linking a change in weight status in childhood to future health outcomes in adulthood. </p> </div> <div class="datacollectionmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Data collection methods</div> <p>Pupilsâ€™ date of birth, sex, ethnicity and postcode (to derive a proxy measure for deprivation) data are obtained from parent questionnaire, or if not available, from school records. Assessments are undertaken in school by trained research staff, using standardised procedures (available on request) and validated instruments at baseline and follow-up time points. In addition, parents of participating children are asked to complete questionnaires at each time point. These cover questions on child and parent demographics, dietary, sedentary, physical and sleep activity habits, home food environment, perceived neighbourhood environment and proximity to food and leisure facilities, family cooking habits and participation in leisure activities. </p> </div> <div class="anthropometricmeasures" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Anthropometric measures</div> <p>All measurements are undertaken barefoot and in light clothing. Standing height is measured at least twice (with a third measure if difference is &amp;gt;0.4 cm) with a Leicester Height Measure. Weight and body fat percentage are measured with a Tanita bioimpedance monitor (Tanita SC-331S; Tanita Corporation., Tokyo, Japan). Waist, arm and thigh circumference are measured at least twice (with a third measure if difference is &amp;gt;0.4 cm, 0.2 cm or 0.2 cm, respectively) using a non-stretch tape-measure. Skinfold thickness at five sites (biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and thigh) are measured at least twice (with a third measure if difference is &amp;gt;0.4 cm) on the non-dominant side, using a Holtain Tanner/Whitehouse Skinfold Caliper (Holtain Ltd., UK). </p> <p>Dietary assessment is undertaken using a validated [ <a href="#CR27">27</a>] simple tick list, the Child and Diet Evaluation Tool (CADET), which is completed by researchers (in school) and parents (out of school) over a 24 hour period.

Justification of sample size</div> <p>Sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome (BMI z-score). Further calculations were also performed to estimate power for the secondary outcome of percentage of children overweight or obese. Planned analysis of the WAVES study will compare outcomes for control and intervention schools at follow-up times, adjusting for baseline measurements. Therefore power calculations undertaken were based on repeated measures methods using estimates of correlation between before and after measurements. A modified version of the design effect [ <a href="#CR35">35</a>] was used to estimate sample size and accommodate varying cluster sizes (using the estimated: mean cluster size (nâ€‰=â€‰25; SDâ€‰=â€‰23). For the primary outcome of BMI z-score, a follow-up sample size of 1000 children split across 50 schools gives the study greater than 90% power to detect a difference of 0.25 BMI z-score between intervention and comparator groups (equivalent to approximately 0.5 kg body weight for a 7-year old child) under all likely estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICCâ€‰=â€‰0 to 0.04, estimated correlation between before and after measuresâ€‰=â€‰0.9 and estimated dropout rateâ€‰=â€‰20%). A change of 0.25 in BMI z-score has been shown to be associated with clinically detectable benefits in obese adolescents [ <a href="#CR36">36</a>] and longitudinal studies demonstrate a linear relationship between BMI z-score in children as young as 7 and heart disease events in adulthood [ <a href="#CR4">4</a>]. Under more conservative estimates for the ICC, this sample size would provide more than 80% power to detect a 0.125 difference in BMI z-score. A BMI z-score difference as low as 0.125 is the primary outcome of choice for other childhood obesity prevention trials [ <a href="#CR37">37</a>]. Allowing for school drop-out (~8%), 54 schools were therefore invited to take part. </p> <p>For the secondary outcome of percentage overweight/obese, this sample size (with an estimated correlation of before and after measures of 0.7 and an ICC of between 0 and 0.02) provides greater than 80% power to detect a difference in the change of proportion of children who are overweight/obese from baseline to follow-up in control compared to intervention schools of about 7% (exact value depends on baseline values). All power calculations were carried out in STATA using the clustersampsi function [ <a href="#CR38">38</a>]. </p> </div> <div class="dataqualityandmanagement" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Data quality and management</div> <p>All study data are stored in a password-protected customised database, hosted by the University of Birmingham.

Discussion</div> <p>To our knowledge, the WAVES study is the first trial of a childhood obesity prevention intervention that: has been developed using the MRC framework for complex interventions, tests both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a school-based intervention and will have sufficient length of follow-up to examine longer term effects. The trial setting includes a diverse socioeconomic and multi-ethnic population to allow exploration of sub-group effects. There is also consideration of a wide range of outcomes, including psychosocial effects to monitor potential harm. </p> <p>The trial will address some of the limitations identified in previous research [ <a href="#CR9">9</a>], particularly including a sample size large enough to detect clinically significant differences in adiposity, use of an objective measure of physical activity, inclusion of cost effectiveness evaluation, a comprehensive process evaluation and assessment of longer term outcomes (all schools at 18 months and half the schools at 27 months post intervention completion). </p> <p>Given the pragmatic and complex nature of the trial, it will not be possible to assess intervention efficacy directly or to disentangle the relative contribution of different intervention components to any observed outcomes. On the other hand, assessment of effectiveness in real settings facilitates future intervention roll-out and dissemination, should the intervention prove to be clinically cost-effective. Thus, the study has the potential to influence health and education policy in the UK and further afield. </p> <p>The comprehensive process evaluation and detailed assessment of implementation alongside the trial will allow us to contextualise and explain the findings of the trial and inform future implementation. It will also allow us to perform analyses to explore the relationship between intervention implementation and outcomes, which has not been undertaken in previous childhood obesity prevention trials. </p> <p>In addition to the findings of the trial, the study will also provide a large dataset on the weight status and other health indicators of a sub sample of multi-ethnic children in the West Midlands, which can be used to address other relevant research questions. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="glossary" title="glossary"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
