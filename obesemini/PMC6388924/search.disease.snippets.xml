  <result pre="of BMI on %BF and percentile curves were constructed. Overall" exact="obesity" post="prevalence estimated by %BF was 43.7%, and by BMI"/>
  <result pre="diagnosis by BMI underestimated around 50% of children diagnosed with" exact="obesity" post="by %BF (≥30% for girls, ≥25% for boys). The"/>
  <result pre="AUCs showed greater discriminative power of BMI to detect %BF" exact="obesity" post="in school children and adolescents (all cases AUC≥0.90) than"/>
