Although 2011&#x02013;2012 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) illustrates that obesity among preschoolers has significantly decreased from previous estimates, racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in childhood obesity persist (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The etiology of childhood obesity is multidimensional and includes familial, organizational, and societal factors. To more effectively address these factors, policymakers and researchers are increasingly promoting social ecological approaches to obesity prevention that encompass multiple community sectors (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Multi-sector approaches require stakeholders to work collaboratively across community sectors to develop and sustain programs that influence policies, systems, and environments in ways that make it easier for families to make healthy lifestyle choices, such as purchasing and consuming healthful food and engaging in physical activity such as outdoor play.</p><p>To effectively support behavior change through a synergistic, multisector approach, stakeholders in participating sectors must be aware of the complex and multifaceted barriers to behavior change encountered by families, particularly low-income families (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Gaps in stakeholder awareness within or across sectors would compromise the concentrated effort needed to prevent obesity; these gaps indicate the need for additional training. However, to our knowledge, the extent to which stakeholders are informed about families&#x02019; experiences in relation to obesity prevention has not been documented in obesity prevention research.</p><p>To address this gap, we interviewed key stakeholders across 5 community sectors: primary health care providers (health care); the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); early care and education (early education), schools, and afterschool programs. Our objectives were to 1) characterize stakeholders&#x02019; perceptions of the barriers low-income parents experience in the context of obesity prevention, 2) examine the extent to which stakeholders&#x02019; perceptions align with parents&#x02019; perceptions as documented in the Family Ecological Model (FEM); and 3) assess variations in stakeholders&#x02019; perceptions by community sector.</p><p>The FEM was used to guide this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref>). FEM was developed to support and guide research in childhood obesity prevention and has been validated with a cohort of low-income families with preschool-aged children via an in-depth qualitative approach (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Consistent with ecological systems theory (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), FEM outlines contextual and family systems factors that influence children&#x02019;s diets, physical activity, and screen-based behaviors and highlights the importance of engaging families in obesity prevention strategies across community sectors. Although FEM includes 4 temporally organized dimensions, this study focused on the 2 dimensions most relevant to understanding the broader life factors that may inhibit healthy lifestyle behaviors in low-income families, Family Ecology and Family Social and Emotional Context. Family Ecology encompasses contextual factors that influence behavior, such as family history and structure, organizational characteristics, community characteristics, and media and policy factors. Family Social and Emotional Context results from the family ecology and includes family knowledge and social norms as well as social disparities and chronic stress. The other 2 FEM dimensions were omitted because they focus on outcomes rather than determinants of behavior change.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure</label><caption><p>The Family Ecological Model.

Both communities are small- to mid-size (population 40,000&#x02013;100,000) with predominantly non-Hispanic white (~68%) and sizeable Hispanic (16%&#x02013;21%) populations. Mean income per capita is approximately $22,000 (state average is $35,000) and rates of poverty range from 23% to 27% (state poverty rate is 12%). MA-CORD includes childhood obesity interventions in 5 sectors, including afterschool programs, schools, health care, WIC, and early education.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible stakeholders were drawn from the 5 community sectors in both MA-CORD communities. All stakeholders who participated in an introductory meeting about MA-CORD were invited to participate in a semistructured interview. Stakeholders who agreed to participate were sent an email after the meeting. Any stakeholders who did not reply after 3 reminders were counted as nonresponders. Of 108 stakeholders who were eligible to participate, 71 were from schools, 17 from afterschool programs, 9 from health care, 6 from WIC, and 5 from early education. A total of 63 stakeholders (58.3% of those eligible) agreed to participate in the study, and 39 stakeholders (61.9% of 63) were interviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Interview procedures</title><p>All interviews were conducted at baseline, after the organizations agreed to participate in MA-CORD but before the implementation of childhood obesity intervention activities. Some training sessions for stakeholders had already been delivered by the time of the interview. Eight stakeholder interviews were conducted face-to-face and 31 by telephone. Two of the authors (C.G. and A.A.) conducted the interviews from September 2012 through March 2013. To mediate potential differences in interview style, an interview guide was developed, and the first 3 interviews were conducted with both interviewers present. All participants gave permission for audio recording. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of Harvard School of Public Health and San Diego State University. Stakeholders were compensated with a $10 gift card.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Interviews were transcribed verbatim and entered into NVivo version 10.0 (QSR International). Data were analyzed through coding and extraction (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). An initial list of codes and definitions was developed on the basis of the Family Ecology and Family Social and Emotional Context domains of FEM (columns 1 and 2 in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref>). Two investigators (C.G. and R.E.B.) pilot-tested this initial list with 5 randomly chosen interviews, which was refined and expanded to incorporate emergent themes. The investigators then independently coded 5 more interviews with the revised scheme. Disagreements in coding were discussed. A consensus meeting with a third investigator (K.K.D.) was held to finalize the coding scheme. Data analysis focused on the extent to which stakeholder descriptions of barriers experienced by low-income families reflected the experiences of low-income families as documented in the FEM model. Coded data were analyzed for potential differences in stakeholder perceptions and sector.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The 39 stakeholders interviewed represented all sectors of MA-CORD.

<bold>Family history and structure.</bold> Within this subdomain, parent education and ethnicity&#x02013;cultural background were mentioned by most stakeholders as affecting parents&#x02019; engagement or participation in childhood obesity prevention. Specifically, 32 (82.0%) out of 39 stakeholders, discussed parent education as a barrier, and 13 (33.3%) out of 39 stakeholders referenced ethnicity&#x02013;cultural background as shaping cultural norms that could negatively affect parents&#x02019; engagement in obesity prevention.</p><p>The main cultural influence cited by 10 (26%) of 39 stakeholders representing all sectors was Hispanic families&#x02019; belief that high body weight is healthy. Participants reported that parents whose families recently immigrated to the United States were proud of their &#x0201c;chubby&#x0201d; children, and saw them as evidence of their ability to provide food (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 1, 2); this concept is important because many families faced food insecurity in their home countries. Five stakeholders (13.0%) mentioned that grandparents&#x02019; beliefs that heavy babies are healthy also greatly influenced families&#x02019; daily routines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 3&#x02013;5). Nine stakeholders (23%) from schools, afterschool programs, and health care discussed parents&#x02019; language and literacy needs, which are examples of parents&#x02019; ethnic&#x02013;cultural background and education (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 6&#x02013;8). Although stakeholders reported addressing these needs by providing bilingual materials and a translator during appointments, these efforts were described as insufficient for fostering parent engagement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quote 9).</p><p>
<bold>Organizational factors.</bold> Fifteen stakeholders (39.0%) agreed that childhood obesity is a sensitive topic and that a good relationship between families and staff in key institutions is important when addressing obesity with families. Fourteen stakeholders (36.0%) representing almost all sectors, but especially from WIC, mentioned that health care providers lack the time to adequately address healthy behaviors because of parents&#x02019; need to discuss competing problems. Cultural competency and provider empathy were also described as playing a role. Additionally, stakeholders stressed that overall health should be addressed rather than overweight or obesity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 10&#x02013;12).</p><p>
<bold>Community factors</bold>
<italic>.</italic> The most important community-level barrier reported by 19 (49.0%) stakeholders was the lack of safe neighborhoods. Safety concerns, including high traffic areas, unsafe sidewalks, and fear of violence, were all mentioned as barriers preventing children from going outside to play (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 13, 14). Sixteen stakeholders (41.0%) across all sectors also described lack of transportation as a barrier. Although afterschool programs and sports clubs were offered free, stakeholders reported that families cannot attend as long as they lack consistent access to transportation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quote 15, 16). Finally, 15 stakeholders (39.0%) across sectors mentioned that low-income families do not have access to affordable, healthful food (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 17, 18).</p><p>
<bold>Media and policy factors.</bold> Seven stakeholders identified media and policy factors, specifically marketing, as a barrier. For example, stakeholders mentioned that advertisements are confusing and irritating and perpetuate the misconception that healthful eating is expensive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 19, 20).</p></sec><sec><title>Family Social and Emotional Context</title><p>
<bold>Family knowledge and social norms.</bold> Thirteen stakeholders (33.0%) named different beliefs about food and physical activity as a barrier. For example, limited nutrition knowledge makes it more difficult for parents to make healthy food decisions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 21&#x02013;23); another perceived barrier is parents&#x02019; belief that any activity except television viewing is physical activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quote 24). Stakeholders noted that asking parents more detailed questions about their children&#x02019;s physical activity often revealed that parents did not actually know what physical activity meant. Consequently, stakeholders reported changing their counseling sessions to include examples of physical activity and different strategies for increasing children&#x02019;s heart rate through physical activity. A total of 26 stakeholders (67.0%) mentioned that parents are often unaware or unconcerned about their child&#x02019;s weight and do not engage in specific efforts to address obesity in their families. Stakeholders from WIC, health care, and early education reported that parents generally do not see weight gain as a problem (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 25&#x02013;26). Additionally, 1 WIC stakeholder said that parents believe that the products distributed through the WIC voucher program (eg, juice, milk, breakfast cereals, cheese, fruits and vegetables, peanut butter [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) are healthful, and therefore, believe they can consume as much as they want (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quote 27).</p><p>Eight stakeholders (21.0%), mainly from WIC, reported parental distrust in stakeholders&#x02019; knowledge related to nutrition, physical activity, and body weight, especially if the child&#x02019;s doctor did not address weight problems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quote 28). Furthermore, 5 stakeholders (14.0%) felt that parents often saw advice related to their children&#x02019;s weight as an intrusion into the way they raise their children (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 29, 30). Several stakeholders also noted that parental distrust may stem from parents observing organizational staff consuming unhealthful foods and having weight problems themselves (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quote 31).</p><p>
<bold>Social disparities and chronic stress</bold>
<italic>.</italic> A total of 34 stakeholders (87%), identified families&#x02019; economic situation, that is, their inability to afford healthful foods and attendance fees, as a significant barrier to healthy lifestyles. Stakeholders reported that low-income families tended to use the support they get through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy cheaper, less healthful foods to be able to afford more food (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 32&#x02013;34). Linked to families&#x02019; economic situation are competing priorities that overrule child obesity and health-risk behaviors. More than half of all stakeholders (22 [56%]), mentioned that families experience competing priorities (eg, homelessness, addiction, food insecurity, being uninsured). Stakeholders said that low-income families would consume whatever food they could afford regardless of whether it was healthful (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quotes 35, 36). Nine stakeholders from health care and WIC said that many parents lacked of a sense of control over, and responsibility for, their child&#x02019;s weight (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, quote 37).</p></sec><sec><title>Differences by sector</title><p>Although there was general cross-sector agreement on barriers parents encounter in obesity prevention, a few differences emerged. Of 16 stakeholders who identified lack of transportation as a barrier, 6 were from the afterschool sector (38%). Half of all stakeholders (4 of 8, 50%) who reported parental distrust in the providers nutritional knowledge, especially when addressing children&#x02019;s weight problems, were from WIC. Eight of 13 stakeholders (62.0%) who identified cultural influences as a barrier to obesity prevention were from WIC and health care. Finally, 9 of 15 stakeholders (60%) who cited the quality of the relationship between families and staff in key institutions as influential to successfully engaging parents in obesity prevention efforts were from WIC and health care. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Multisector interventions are recommended to prevent obesity in children. The success of such interventions requires not only that stakeholders are sensitive to the challenges experienced by low-income families in the context of obesity, but that there is congruence across sectors in stakeholders&#x02019; understanding of these challenges. Results from this study illustrate that stakeholders participating in MA-CORD have an intricate understanding of barriers to obesity prevention and control experienced by low-income parents. Stakeholder reports reflected awareness of the broader contextual factors affecting families in addition to social and emotional dynamics within families that could cause families to engage in obesity prevention.</p><p>Although stakeholder reports generally overlapped with FEM, numerous key areas not specifically highlighted in FEM were mentioned. Examples include parents&#x02019; language or literacy levels and the cultural competency and empathy of health care providers, which include the use of acceptable terminology when discussing a child&#x02019;s weight. These themes are distinct from constructs referenced in FEM, such as parents&#x02019; ethnicity&#x02013;cultural background, quality of relationship with staff, and parents&#x02019; distrust of health care providers, and they have implications for intervention approaches. For example, stakeholders acknowledged that having materials in Spanish and offering translator services was insufficient to improve provider&#x02013;parent communication. The challenges extended beyond parent cultural background and the general provider&#x02013;parent relationship and probably involved parents&#x02019; health literacy levels and provider and organizational levels of cultural competency, thus highlighting the need to emphasize these subdomains in future applications of FEM.</p><p>Another important finding that emerged is the role that extended family members such as grandparents play in food selection and a child&#x02019;s weight, especially in Hispanic families (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Although the role of extended family members is subsumed in ethnicity&#x02013;cultural background in FEM, it may not be sufficiently emphasized. Previous research illustrates that grandparents have a strong caregiving role in Hispanic families (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In our study, community stakeholders repeatedly mentioned the effect that grandparents had on their ability to communicate healthy lifestyle practices to parents. Stakeholders also mentioned that parents acquire their knowledge of nutrition from their own parents. These results underline the importance of explicitly including extended family members in childhood obesity prevention and control when working in communities with a large number of Hispanic families.</p><p>Results from this study have numerous implications for practice. First, results suggest that stakeholders, particularly stakeholders focusing on childhood obesity prevention, may be appropriately aware of the challenges experienced by low-income families in the context of obesity prevention; thus, attempts to increase stakeholders&#x02019; awareness through education may not be a good use of resources. Resources could be directed toward increasing parents&#x02019; health literacy levels, ensuring organizational cultural competency, and explicitly including extended family members in health promotion. Findings also iterate the importance of addressing contextual and family-level barriers when planning and conducting new interventions. Offering free programs at times parents are unable to participate with their children or when no transportation is available limits participation.</p><p>This study has numerous strengths. Community stakeholders play important roles in multisector obesity interventions, but to date they have not been emphasized in research in this area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine key stakeholders&#x02019; perceptions of barriers to engaging low-income families in childhood obesity prevention across multiple community sectors. An important aspect of this study is the inclusion of stakeholders representing 5 community sectors. The use of a qualitative approach also provided the opportunity to delve more deeply into stakeholders&#x02019; views regarding facilitators and barriers to obesity prevention. Although interview questions were broad and open-ended and did not explicitly prompt theoretical constructs, results were highly consistent with the underlying theoretical model, lending further credibility to the results.</p><p>Despite these strengths, there are also numerous limitations, which need to be considered when interpreting the results. Because the study was nested within MA-CORD, stakeholders may have already had a strong interest in childhood obesity and may not represent stakeholders in other low-income communities. In addition, some intervention sectors were underrepresented; therefore, study findings may not fully represent the views of all stakeholders in these communities. Finally, stakeholder training had been initiated in some sectors at the time of the interviews. Although training sessions did not focus on barriers to obesity prevention experienced by low-income families, they may have increased stakeholder awareness of childhood obesity, thereby influencing interview responses.</p><p>This study adds to the literature by capturing the perceptions and experiences of key stakeholders across community sectors regarding barriers that low-income parents encounter when engaging in childhood obesity prevention. Findings illustrate stakeholders&#x02019; holistic awareness of the complexity of factors affecting families in the context of childhood obesity prevention and the consistency of those perspectives across community sectors. These results are encouraging because they suggest that some of the fundamental building blocks of multisector interventions for obesity prevention for vulnerable children and their families may already be in place. Resources may be more appropriately directed toward increasing parents&#x02019; health literacy levels, ensuring organizational cultural competency, and explicitly including extended family members as program targets in health promotion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, award no.
