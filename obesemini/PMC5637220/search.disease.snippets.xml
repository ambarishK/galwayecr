  <result pre="is also expected to increase, effective interventions to prevent childhood" exact="obesity" post="are needed. Therefore, we conducted a Delphi study to"/>
  <result pre="determine the priorities of a potential intervention research on childhood" exact="obesity" post="prevention and its adequacy and feasibility. Methods The two-round"/>
