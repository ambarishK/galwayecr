Although the problem is global, it mainly affects low and middle-income countries and urban areas. There are approximately 42 million overweight children in the world in 2013 and close to 31 million of these live in developing countries [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The problem has a high priority in Turkey. Today, obesity is accepted as one of the most frequently seen chronic diseases among children [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many regional and several national surveys have been conducted so far to define the dimensions of the problem, and several strategy documents have been prepared for the prevention and management of CO [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>]. In Turkey in 2009, the prevalence of overweight in 6&#x02013;9-year-old children was found to be 14.3% and of obesity 6.5% [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In another study carried out in 2013 among 7 and 8-year-old children, the prevalence of overweight was 14.2% and of obesity was 8.3% [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>It is essential to recognize obesity at an early stage and treat it appropriately to prevent it. In Turkey, Family Health Centres (FHCs) are responsible for individual-based prevention and treatment. In these centres no other specialists, but only general practitioners and family medicine specialists, are working and are all named as family physicians (FPs). They provide primary healthcare services for all age groups. Even though the primary care services are identified as the main source responsible for managing CO, there are various barriers for the effective management of the problem identified in the literature. Lack of training, time constraint, lack of resources, concerns related to communicating with the parents about child&#x02019;s weight, health system related factors such as lack of reward were identified as important barriers to addressing childhood obesity [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;13</xref>].</p><p>Almost all CO research in Turkey has focused on epidemiological and clinical aspects of the problem, and there are no studies which allow determining the factors impeding the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of CO in primary care. We planned our study to examine the views of FPs about their role and the barriers they perceive in the management of CO.</p></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0004"><title>Study design</title><p>We used a mixed methods approach in which both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The data were collected between February and May 2014 among FPs in two major counties of Istanbul. These counties were the oldest, well-settled, and central neighbourhoods of the city with residents of middle class and at least five years of school education. Quantitative data was collected with a structured questionnaire; in-depth interviews obtained qualitative data. The reason for adding qualitative data to the study was to elaborate the views of FPs about their roles in the management of CO and the barriers they perceived. During the in-depth interview, we asked them to tell us more about these issues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Marmara University Institute of Health Sciences in 07.02.2014 (protocol no. 1400031936).</p><sec id="s0006"><title>Data collection&#x02014;quantitative study</title><p>All 82 FHCs in the region were visited. Of 284 FPs assigned at these centres, 180 FPs volunteered to be complete a structured questionnaire (63.4%). The questionnaire consisted of 22 questions on demographic and occupational characteristics of the physicians and questions related to their attitude and practice on the management of CO in primary care. The questions were taken from a questionnaire used in a study carried out in Australia [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The questionnaires were distributed and recollected by the four researchers at FPs offices.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Data collection&#x02014;qualitative study</title><p>When the questionnaire had been completed, the physicians were asked if they would be willing to join a follow-up in-depth interview, and those who agreed (48 FPs) were asked for their contact information. We had in-depth interviews using a semi-structured interview guide until we reached saturation. We covered three issues in the guide: how do FPs perceive their role in the management of CO (including reasons behind), what are their explanations about the obstacles, and what do they suggest for solutions. For the enrolment to the in-depth interview, the diversity of the answers was prioritized, and the interviews were continued until saturation was achieved (after 25 interviews) [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The same four authors interviewed the FPs at their offices and recorded the interviews with the consent of the physicians.

Most FPs agreed that they have a role in managing CO. Almost all FPs agreed that for the 0&#x02013;4-year-olds&#x02019; height and weight measures should be taken. However, only two thirds of FPs recommended this for children aged 5&#x02013;15 years. The most reported barriers in the management of CO were lack of time and the fact that in Turkey FHCs are not being utilized for the care of children aged 5&#x02013;15 years. In-depth interviews showed that FPs tend to limit their role to identifying the problem and making the family aware of it.</p></sec><sec id="s0024"><title>Limited role of FPs</title><p>The critical role of the FPs and primary care setting in the management of obesity is well known [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the current study, half of the FPs stated that &#x02018;the main role of an FP is to refer obese children to other professionals rather than attempting to treat them.&#x02019; In a similar study in Australia, however, only 20% of the general practitioners agreed [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The results of the qualitative part of the study showed that there might be two reasons behind this opinion of FPs. First, FPs accept &#x02018;prevention&#x02019; to be their primary role. Second, due to the lack of technical (i.e., specific laboratory tests) and professional support (lack of integration or coordination with other disciplines), they limit their role. Lack of integration or coordination between primary and secondary healthcare has been mentioned as a problem of primary healthcare in previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Barriers and solutions</title><sec id="s0026"><title>Knowledge</title><p>Lack of knowledge regarding management of CO was also reported in this study as a barrier among FPs. This lack may indicate a need of effective training of FPs in the management of CO. All these factors were reported in other studies as factors discouraging FPs from treating CO [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>]. However, a lack of standardized guidelines was mentioned by only a few FPs in our study; although this has been reported as an important problem in other studies [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0027"><title>Motivation</title><p>Almost 40% of FPs in our study indicated a lack of motivation as a barrier for the management of CO.

However, payment cut off occurs if FPs cannot reach specific targets.</p></sec><sec id="s0028"><title>Workload</title><p>Lack of time and an excess workload of FPs were reported in both quantitative and qualitative parts of our study. Lack of time has been reported by FPs in Turkey as well as in other studies from different countries [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Although we found a similar result in our study, FPs have given the maximum priority in the management of CO to the parents (91.6%); school and teachers (52.5%) following the FPs (74.3%) in third place. Parental participation and cooperation are key factors in the prevention and management of CO [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;32</xref>]. Parents&#x02019; lack of recognition or concern about obesity in children has been one of the main barriers in managing the CO [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
