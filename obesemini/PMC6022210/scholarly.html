Abstract</div> <p>Social media and text messaging show promise as public health interventions, but little evaluation of implementation exists. The B’more Healthy Communities for Kids (BHCK) was a multilevel, multicomponent (wholesalers, food stores, recreation centers) childhood obesity prevention trial that included social media and text-messaging components. The BHCK was implemented in 28 low-income areas of Baltimore City, Maryland, in 2 waves. The texting intervention targeted 241 low-income African American caregivers (of 283), who received 3 texts/week reinforcing key messages, providing nutrition information, and weekly goals. Regular posting on social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) targeted community members and local stakeholders. High implementation standards were set a priori (57 for social media, 11 for texting), with low implementation defined as &amp;lt;50%, medium as 50% to 99%, high as ≥100% of the high standard for each measure. Reach, dose delivered, and fidelity were assessed via web-based analytic tools. Between waves, social media implementation improved from low-moderate to high reach, dose delivered, and fidelity. Text messaging increased from moderate to high in reach and dose delivered, fidelity decreased from high to moderate. Data were used to monitor and revise the BHCK intervention throughout implementation. Our model for evaluating text messaging–based and social media–based interventions may be applicable to other settings. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

Introduction</div> <p>Obesity is a public health crisis with significant costs for individuals, communities, and governments. <sup> <a href="#bibr1-0046958018779189">1</a>, <a href="#bibr2-0046958018779189">2</a> </sup> In Baltimore, the obesity epidemic affects adults and children, particularly black and lower income populations with less access to healthful foods. <sup> <a href="#bibr3-0046958018779189">3</a>, <a href="#bibr4-0046958018779189">4</a> </sup> </p> <p>As there are various factors that contribute to childhood obesity, research has urged for multilevel interventions that simultaneously address these factors. <sup> <a href="#bibr5-0046958018779189">5</a>, <a href="#bibr6-0046958018779189">6</a> </sup> Multilevel-multicomponent (ML-MC) interventions intervene at multiple settings concurrently (eg, corner stores, worksites, and recreation centers) and use multiple components (eg, education, social marketing, policy) to target sustainable systems change. <sup> <a href="#bibr7-0046958018779189">7</a> </sup> However, these programs can be costly to implement and may have weak reach to target audiences due to diffusion of limited resources. <sup> <a href="#bibr7-0046958018779189">7</a>, <a href="#bibr8-0046958018779189">8</a> </sup> Multiple intervention strategies need to connect and reinforce each other, such that intervention components are synchronized across levels. <sup> <a href="#bibr7-0046958018779189">7</a> </sup> </p> <p>Social media and text messaging have the potential to support multilevel interventions due to their high reach, relatively low cost, and ability to tie together diverse interventions. <sup> <a href="#bibr9-0046958018779189">9</a>, <a href="#bibr10-0046958018779189">10</a> </sup> Internet and social media use have substantially risen over the past decade, with 65% of American adults using at least 1 social media site as of 2015. <sup> <a href="#bibr11-0046958018779189">11</a> </sup> Social media refers to Internet-based platforms that allow people to communicate and interact. <sup> <a href="#bibr10-0046958018779189">10</a> </sup> Text messaging is another common form of communication across all age groups; more than 70% of cell phone owners in the age groups 18 to 29 years, 30 to 49 years, and 50 to 64 years cited that they used their phones to send or receive text messages in 2013. <sup> <a href="#bibr12-0046958018779189">12</a> </sup> African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to text than their white counterparts. <sup> <a href="#bibr12-0046958018779189">12</a> </sup> Although several interventions have successfully tested social media and text messaging’s positive effect on healthy eating, <sup> <a href="#bibr9-0046958018779189">9</a> </sup> weight loss, <sup> <a href="#bibr13-0046958018779189">13</a> </sup> and physical activity, <sup> <a href="#bibr14-0046958018779189">14</a>, <a href="#bibr15-0046958018779189">15</a> </sup> few have set evaluation metrics for these strategies, which detracts from our understanding and use of these technologies as intervention tools. <sup> <a href="#bibr14-0046958018779189">14</a>, <a href="#bibr16-0046958018779189">16</a> </sup> In addition, we have not identified any study to date that has set standards for implementation of social media and text messaging in a ML-MC obesity prevention intervention. This paper addresses these gaps by describing the process evaluation of the text messaging and social media components of the B’more Healthy Communities for Kids (BHCK) intervention. <sup> <a href="#bibr17-0046958018779189">17</a> </sup> </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Intervention Overview</div> <p>The BHCK was a childhood obesity prevention, group-randomized trial implemented in 2 waves. <sup> <a href="#bibr17-0046958018779189">17</a> </sup> In each wave, 14 zones were selected upon meeting study’s eligibility criteria: low-income, predominantly African American (&amp;gt;50%) neighborhood with a recreation center at least 0.5 miles from a supermarket. Neighborhoods were randomized to be an intervention or comparison zone (n = 28 total zones). Different zones were used for waves 1 and 2. Within each zone, an evaluation sample of African American caregivers, defined as any adult (&amp;gt;18 years old) responsible for taking care of a 10- to 14-year-old child, was actively recruited at community sites (eg, recreation centers, corner stores, carryout restaurants, parks). The first wave of BHCK intervention was implemented from June 2014 to February 2015; the second wave from November 2015 to July 2016. <sup> <a href="#bibr17-0046958018779189">17</a> </sup> Our evaluation sample included 150 and 133 caregivers in wave 1 and wave 2, respectively. The BHCK intervened on different components of the Baltimore food environment (corner stores, carryout restaurants, wholesaler, and recreation centers) and at different socioecological levels (policy, small food stores, afterschool program, and informational environment—social media and text messaging). </p> <p>Prior to intervention, three focus groups with youth, ages 10 to 14 years, and their adult caregivers were conducted in predominantly African American communities in Baltimore (n = 20). Most participants used at least one of the following social media sites: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Tumblr, with Facebook being most popular. Participants were open to communicating and receiving BHCK updates through social media and texts, and provided feedback on the types of messages they preferred to receive. </p> <p>Based on the formative research, we chose Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and text messaging to reach caregivers and connect and reinforce various BHCK intervention components. Content delivered on these platforms paralleled the 3 phases delivered in other intervention levels: smart drinks, smart snacks, and smart cooking. Intervention was guided by social cognitive theory, with goal-setting messages and bidirectional interactions to enhance self-efficacy and reinforce positive health behaviors to encourage behavioral change. <sup> <a href="#bibr18-0046958018779189">18</a> </sup> Sharing recipes and individual stories of success on our social media accounts and text-messaging campaign promoted observational learning. Replying encouraging messages to BHCK participants who texted us with questions or responses to our challenge-of-the-week text messages also promoted behavioral reinforcement. The BHCK interventionists also sought to improve self-efficacy with supportive posts that helped people to identify where healthier choices were available in their food environment, especially when promoted healthy food and drink items were stocked and on sale in the corner stores and carryout restaurants that were cooperating with BHCK. </p> <p>The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board (IRB No. 00004203) approved this research; written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants. </p> </div> <div class="socialmediaandtext-messagingrecruitment" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Social Media and Text-Messaging Recruitment</div> <p>Wave 1 recruitment for social media and text messaging started 1 month before overall BHCK intervention in June 2014 to build initial follower base. All eligible caregivers in the intervention evaluation arm (n = 150) were invited to join via email, phone, and letter using contact information gathered at their baseline interview. <sup> <a href="#bibr17-0046958018779189">17</a> </sup> Participants could choose between receiving 3 and 5 texts per week. They joined the text-messaging program with a specific keyword and were invited to follow BHCK social media pages. </p> <p>Wave 2 recruitment of caregivers in the evaluation intervention sample (n = 133) took place during the baseline interview (April-November 2015). Those who were not invited or initially declined invitation were called afterward about enrolling in the program. Based on wave 1 participants’ preference for 3 texts per week, all wave 2 participants were texted 3 texts per week at off-peak hours. </p> <p>To involve the community, social media handles were printed on all wave 2 posters and handouts distributed at stores and recreation centers, and on cooperating carryout menus. Participants in the intervention evaluation arm were actively invited to follow the pages through email, mail, texts, and calls. Unlike text messaging, social media pages were open to the public to reach a larger audience and potential stakeholders. </p> </div> <div class="text-messagingintervention" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Text-Messaging Intervention</div> <p>The BHCK text-messaging intervention targeted adult caregivers. Messages were drafted by BHCK interventionists, who were undergraduate and graduate students trained in nutrition and public health, revised by the registered dietitians on the research team, approved by the primary investigator. The content was designed to encourage bidirectional communication and allowed for individual follow-up ( <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0046958018779189">Supplemental Table S1</a>). Contact names were used to personalize text messages. First text of the week was goal-oriented, with the promoted task related to the unit concurrently taught at the recreation center and corner stores. To encourage response from participants, a <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> question was typically sent at the end of the week, asking whether they achieved the weekly challenge. Other message content included information to support goal attainment, nutrition information, recipes for promoted food items, and their cost and availability at corner stores ( <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0046958018779189">Supplemental Table S1</a>). Enrolled participants could opt-out at any point. </p> <p> <i>TextIt</i> ( <a href="https://textit.in">https://textit.in</a>) was used in wave 1, because it allowed scheduling of message flows, with automated responses to preset questions. Due to issues with message delivery and scheduling inflexibility, BHCK switched to <i>EZ Texting</i> ( <a href="https://app.eztexting.com">https://app.eztexting.com</a>) during wave 2. The BHCK also used <i>MobileVip</i> ( <a href="http://mobilevip.me">http://mobilevip.me</a>), a custom-made texting platform that allowed scheduling of automated responses to preset questions and improved successful text message delivery. </p> </div> <div class="socialmediaintervention" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Social Media Intervention</div> <p>Social media, namely Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, broadened BHCK by targeting the whole Baltimore community. Content promoted other program components, including BHCK posters and handouts, photos from recreation centers and corner store interventions, the youth leaders (local college students trained to deliver the BHCK afterschool program), and cooperating wholesalers and corner storeowners. The BHCK social media also shared Baltimore-specific news and community events to engage the community. </p> <div class="facebook" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Facebook</div> <p>It allowed for longer and more frequent posts than text messaging and the other social media platforms (ie, Instagram and Twitter) and use of links, photos and videos, creating a more comprehensive communication platform to reach study sample and other members within and beyond Baltimore. The wave 1 Facebook page was maintained for wave 2 to retain initial follower base. Using a set weekly posting schedule ( <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0046958018779189">Supplemental Table S2</a>), interventionists posted at least once a day in the evening, which was when most of BHCK’s followers were online based on <i>Facebook Analytics</i>, to optimize post engagement. </p> </div> <div class="instagram" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Instagram</div> <p>During wave 1, users were less engaged with the "BHCK1" Instagram page than our Facebook Page, such that the Instagram page had much fewer followers and likes and comments per post. A new account with a catchier title of "Bmore4kids" was hence created for wave 2. Before wave 2 implementation, preintervention posting about general nutrition and networking (via liking, following, and commenting) with users within the target community helped create a substantial follower base (n = 1443) with the aim of giving credence to the account as a reliable source for nutrition advice and community news. The BHCK interventionists posted according to a weekly posting schedule ( <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0046958018779189">Supplemental Table S3</a>) with 1 to 2 posts per day, as posting on average 1.5 times per day was found to be best practice. <sup> <a href="#bibr19-0046958018779189">19</a> </sup> All Instagram posts were generally linked to and posted on Facebook. The BHCK had weekly Instagram challenges that corresponded to that week’s text-messaging goal, and large giveaway challenges per phase to increase participation. Large giveaway challenges were different to the weekly challenges in that they are larger scale, with the competition open for entry for longer than a week and involved gift incentives, such that all Baltimore residents who participated in the giveaway would be entered into a random drawing for a prize. </p> </div> <div class="twitter" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Twitter</div> <p>In wave 1, Twitter was used to connect with caregivers and shared similar content to Facebook and Instagram. However, we found poor engagement, as local caregivers were not active Twitter users. The BHCK team learned Baltimore policy makers and organizations were more active on Twitter, so a new Twitter page, "Bmore4kids," was created for wave 2. It focused on connecting with agencies that had an interest in changing the food environment and supplemented the BHCK policy component. </p> </div> <div class="boostinganduseofhashtags" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Boosting and use of hashtags</div> <p>To increase reach, BHCK paid to "boost" 1 to 2 posts per week on Facebook near the end of wave 1 and on all social media platforms during wave 2. "Boosted" posts display content to a broader preselected audience: adults ages 18 to 65 in Baltimore City. The BHCK interventionists also boosted its overall Facebook page and tracked both paid and organic, meaning via unpaid distribution, average reach (ie, number of people who saw any activity from the page) per month. Hashtags are prevalently used on social media, especially Twitter and Instagram, to categorize and help users find content. Ten BHCK hashtags were created with 2 hashtags per phase based on the 3 phase slogans used on BHCK communication materials (eg, #RefreshBHCK #SnackSmartBHCK) ( <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0046958018779189">Supplemental Table S4</a>). </p> </div> </div> <div class="definitionsofkeyprocessindicators" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Definitions of Key Process Indicators</div> <p>Prior to intervention, process evaluation standards were created to track implementation quality and make improvements during the program. Multiple reach, dose delivered, and fidelity indicators were initially developed based on previous intervention experience, <sup> <a href="#bibr20-0046958018779189">20</a> </sup> and applied to each social media platform and text messaging, reviewed and refined as needed during BHCK team meetings (bimonthly). <i>Reach</i> was defined as the number of followers and impressions, ie, the number of times the page or post was displayed, or percentage of families in the evaluation sample enrolled in the text-messaging program. <i>Dose delivered</i> accounted for the number of BHCK posts on social media platforms and text messages sent. <i>Fidelity</i> was the effectiveness of the text-messaging and social media components, and measured indirectly through level of engagement that the page, posts, and texts generated (eg, likes, comments, replies), and follower retention rate. </p> </div> <div class="processevaluationstandards" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Process Evaluation Standards</div> <p>Reach, dose delivered, and fidelity were measured by 20 preset standards in wave 1 and an expanded set of 68 standards in wave 2 ( <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0046958018779189">Supplemental Tables S5-S7</a>). The BHCK set standards based on current literature, <sup> <a href="#bibr13-0046958018779189">13</a>, <a href="#bibr21-0046958018779189">21</a> </sup> and measurement data available from social media analytical sites. Each standard could be met at a low, medium, or high level, with high being the goal to reflect optimum intervention delivery according to BHCK initial plans. Aiming to improve implementation for wave 2, ranges for low, medium, and high were increased (ie, high ranges in wave 1 standards were set as moderate for wave 2). The BHCK also modified its social media standards based on lessons learned and experience from wave 1. Due to the different process evaluation standards used between waves 1 and 2, this paper evaluates implementation of both waves using wave 2 standards. Impact results for the BHCK intervention are presented elsewhere. <sup> <a href="#bibr22-0046958018779189">22</a> </sup> </p> </div> <div class="datasourcesandanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Although engagement assessed for BHCK social media pages included individuals beyond our target audience (as pages were open to the general public), an overall higher engagement level would still reflect improvement in the intervention’s fidelity. </p> <p>The BHCK interventionists found that posting timely and personalized content (ie, cultural-specific and community-specific posts, individualized text responses) and encouraging goal-setting and discussion were successful ways to promote each platform. These techniques were also shown to be successful in previous mobile-based <sup> <a href="#bibr14-0046958018779189">14</a>, <a href="#bibr24-0046958018779189">24</a> </sup> and social media interventions. <sup> <a href="#bibr21-0046958018779189">21</a> </sup> </p> <p>Beyond boosting to increase reach, social networking was most effective at increasing reach and gaining followers. Throughout wave 2, BHCK interventionists dedicated time to like and retweet from relevant Twitter accounts, and join Twitter chats. The BHCK also made "shout-out" posts for other accounts on Instagram and Facebook, to feature weekly challenge winners and connect with other users. Dose delivered standards were set in wave 2 to track these activities. </p> <p>Linking social media pages also helped increase reach by spreading messages to a greater audience. The BHCK Instagram posts were always linked to Facebook and often to Twitter. The BHCK interventionists observed increases in likes and comments on linked posts. However, effectiveness of different media types varies within platforms. For instance, hyperlinks cannot be shared on Instagram; Facebook followers were less likely to watch a video if a link was posted instead of the video itself. </p> <p>A limitation found in this study and previous studies <sup> <a href="#bibr16-0046958018779189">16</a> </sup> was that the quantifiable engagement with social media posts and text messages was not always directly correlated with behavioral change. Including specific measures for behavior changes within intervention may help, such as asking users to post a photo of their home-cooked meal, which BHCK did as part of its large Instagram challenges. </p> <p>Another challenge encountered was in assessing percentage of the evaluation sample participating in BHCK social media sites due to individuals’ privacy settings and use of different usernames. To overcome this, BHCK tried to gauge engagement by using example posts in the dose received ("exposure") evaluation during post-intervention assessment with study participants. </p> <p>The BHCK texting response rate was low compared with another study that received an average 68.5% response rate to self-monitoring text messages. <sup> <a href="#bibr13-0046958018779189">13</a> </sup> Difference in response rates was likely due to the sample population age, as their participants were college students, who are probably more familiar with texting than BHCK’s older caregiver sample (mean age = 41 years). However, like the study by Napolitano et al, BHCK participants also reported positive feedback about receiving health-related text messages. </p> <p>Finally, changes in standards between waves 1 and 2 prevented comparison between some process evaluation standards. However, new process evaluation measures were added based on best practices and lessons learned in wave 1, and ultimately improved evaluation and implementation during wave 2. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="conclusions"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p>The BHCK showed that social media and text messaging were innovative tools to include in and increase reach of a multilevel community intervention. Valuable improvements in intervention implementation made in wave 2, based on lessons learned from wave 1, suggest the benefit of implementing the program in 2 waves and conducting detailed process evaluation. The overall high level of reach and fidelity achieved by end of intervention demonstrated the need for consistent high dose delivery and community interest in using social media and text messages to receive and engage with health-related topics. This study shows the importance of understanding the target audience’s usage of social media (ie, which platform(s), frequency, peak hours) to maximize engagement and successfully utilize it as an intervention tool. Recommended practices for managing social media sites include boosting, networking with other accounts, and posting varied and population-relevant content consistently. In the text-messaging program, use of personalized texts, goal-oriented messages, and yes-or-no prompt questions were among the recommended strategies. This work furthers the field by identifying features that increase engagement and retention of target audience and detailing an effective implementation plan and process evaluation standards for social media and text messaging. Future researchers can apply these practices in their own interventions to promote behavior change and improve reach. </p> </div> <div class="supplementary-material" title="supplementary-material"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
