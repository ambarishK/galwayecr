Health services are well placed to deliver preventive programs to families, however, they usually rely on voluntary attendance, which is challenging given low parental engagement. This study explored factors influencing engagement in the <italic>Infant Program</italic>: a group-based obesity prevention program facilitated by maternal and child health nurses within first-time parent groups. Six 1.5 h sessions were delivered at three-month intervals when the infants were 3&#x02013;18 months. A multi-site qualitative exploratory approach was used, and program service providers and parents were interviewed. Numerous interrelated factors were identified, linked to two themes: the transition to parenthood, and program processes. Personal factors enabling engagement included parents&#x02019; heightened need for knowledge, affirmation and social connections. Adjusting to the baby&#x02019;s routine and increased parental self-efficacy were associated with diminished engagement. Organisational factors that challenged embedding program delivery into routine practice included aspects of program promotion, referral and scheduling and workforce resources. Program factors encompassed program content, format, resources and facilitators, with the program being described as meeting parental expectations, although some messages were perceived as difficult to implement. The study findings provide insight into potential strategies to address modifiable barriers to parental engagement in early-year interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>childhood obesity</kwd><kwd>parental engagement</kwd><kwd>maternal and child health</kwd><kwd>research translation</kwd><kwd>implementation</kwd><kwd>infant feeding</kwd><kwd>active play</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-10-00509"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The &#x02018;early years&#x02019;, more recently defined as the first 1000 days (conception to 24 months), is widely acknowledged as a crucial period in laying the foundation for life-long learning and development [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and more specifically, for the prevention of childhood obesity [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Globally, an estimated 41 million children aged under five are overweight or obese [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Australia, 20% of children aged 2&#x02013;4 years are overweight or obese [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with predictions that this could reach 33% by 2025 [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One in three children living in lower socioeconomic areas (33%) are overweight or obese compared with those living in higher socioeconomic areas (19%), while levels are comparable across urban (26%) or regional (27%) areas [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Overweight, obesity and related comorbidities track into adulthood. The health consequences of these conditions in childhood are thus well expressed across the life course, such as diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, respiratory disease, mental health and reproductive disorders [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p><p>Parents and carers play a significant role in influencing the health and development of their children, and supporting parents to develop their knowledge, skills and confidence regarding child health and development is considered an important public health strategy [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Family-based health services are well placed to deliver preventive interventions in the form of group-based programs and alternative modalities [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Unlike treatment services, however, preventive interventions usually rely on voluntary attendance. Low engagement is common, resulting in program benefits being diluted and program delivery being costly to the organisation [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p><p>Australian parents are highly receptive to information and support during the first year of their infant&#x02019;s life, making an average of 11 visits to their general practitioner and 14 visits to their maternal and child health nurse, with the majority of these unrelated to illness [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The universal free maternal and child health service available in Victoria, Australia, provides 10 &#x0201c;Key Age and Stage&#x0201d; consultations between birth and age 3.5 years [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This service is highly accessed, with &#x0003e;90% attendance rates for the 2-, 4- and 8-week and 4-month appointments; 80% attendance rates for the 8- and 12-month appointments; and &#x0003e;60% attendance rates for the 2- and 3.5-year appointments [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Parental engagement is a complex phenomenon, broadly defined as &#x0201c;getting participants to come&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A range of terms are used to describe the &#x0201c;engagement trajectory&#x0201d;, including recruitment and enrolment; participation and involvement; attendance and retention; and completion, termination and attrition [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Wen (2016) also describes engagement as comprising two broad dimensions of quantity (attendance rates or dosage) and quality (participant interactions with the program), suggesting that the quality of the interactions may be a stronger predictor of program outcomes than the quantity of participation [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Studies investigating parental engagement in family-oriented prevention programs and community-based home visiting programs have begun to examine patterns and variations of attendance, to determine impacts in relation to specific time points of engagement [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This has led to the differentiation of participants into categories of attendance, such as &#x0201c;early terminators&#x0201d; (completing 25% or less of the program) [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], &#x0201c;completers&#x0201d; (completing 80% or more of the program) and &#x0201c;non-completers&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], or &#x0201c;non-initiators&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;initiators&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;late dropouts&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;low and high sporadic attenders&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. </p><p>Examining patterns of attendance is considered important to determine if there are sensitive periods when attrition is more likely to occur [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the reasons for this [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Understanding the different barriers and enablers that influence parental engagement, especially for those most in need of services but least likely to access them [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], is valuable. Such findings can inform the development of appropriate strategies to enhance program reach and sustained delivery, thereby improving the cost-effectiveness and health impacts of the intervention or program [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Enablers and barriers to engagement are most commonly categorised into personal, organisational and program factors.

Kelleher (2017) sub-categorises barriers further into modifiable and non-modifiable factors, with modifiable factors regarded as potentially preventable [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. </p><p>Studies of the enablers and barriers to engagement have most frequently been conducted in the context of children with behavioural [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], mental health [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or weight management issues [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], or children who have complex medical concerns [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or vulnerable families [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Understanding and interpreting the data can therefore be influenced by the roles and backgrounds of the researchers and should be made explicit. P.L. and E.L. conducted all interviews. P.L. undertook full data coding and thematic analysis, with cross-checking for coding consistency and input into final theming by R.L. and K.C. All researchers are mothers and qualified dietitians/nutritionists working within a research context. E.L. is a research assistant with experience in researching infant and child nutrition practices.

Six 1.5 h sessions are delivered at three-monthly intervals, commencing when infants are around three months of age. The program is underpinned by parenting support theory and utilises an anticipatory guidance framework to guide content delivery focused on feeding and active play [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

The main source of program referral is the maternal and child health nurse (MCHN) via the universal, free &#x0201c;Key Ages and Stages&#x0201d; appointments provided to all mothers across Victoria. Recruitment to the program is typically through first-time (new) parent groups, with LGAs using either an opt-in or opt-out approach. The opt-in approach involves enrolling interested parents for the first session and parents self-enrolling for subsequent sessions. The opt-out approach involves enrolling interested parents for all sessions at the start and parents indicating their attendance in response to text notifications. All LGAs send reminder text notifications to registered parents ahead of each scheduled session. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-10-00509"><title>2.2.

Interested parents were directed to a short online survey to collect data on program attendance, level of education, home language, postal code, and consent to participate in a 30 min telephone interview. To examine engagement in relation to patterns of attendance, program attendance was categorised into three levels; &#x02018;non-attendance&#x02019;, defined as having registered interest but not attended any program sessions; &#x02018;low attendance&#x02019;, defined as attending three or fewer of the six program sessions; and &#x02018;high attendance&#x02019;, defined as attending four or more of the six program sessions.

Parents were asked how they had heard about the <italic>Infant Program</italic>, what prompted them to enrol, their sources of information and support regarding infant feeding, and their expectations of the program. Non-attendees were asked about reasons for not attending and how these barriers may have been addressed. Low and high attendees were asked about their expectations of the program, reasons for intermittent attendance and how these barriers may have been addressed. High attendees were asked about reasons for continued attendance.</p><p>Audio-recorded interviews were professionally transcribed verbatim. A sample of interviews were initially coded by three researchers (P.L., R.C. and K.C.) to check for coding consistency, then all interviews were coded by P.L. using NVivo. Thematic analysis was undertaken, with initial codes based on phrases emerging systematically and repetitively across the data, and consensus on final themes developed in agreement between two researchers (P.L. and R.L.).

Factors Influencing Parental Engagement</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00509-f001">Figure 1</xref> reflects the complexity and interrelationship of the factors influencing engagement as identified by parents and program service providers. Two emerging themes were apparent&#x02014;the transition to parenthood and program processes&#x02014;which are outlined briefly here and described in more detail below. As new parents, the <italic>transition to parenthood</italic> heightened the need for information, especially on infant feeding, and the need to share experiences with other parents. new parent groups and maternal and child health services fulfilled these needs as trusted sources of information and opportunities to form social connections; and were therefore regarded as good opportunities to recruit parents into the program. Accessing information through other (informal) sources, such as family and social media, and adjusting to the baby&#x02019;s routine, were likely to reduce parent engagement. <italic>Aligning program processes</italic> to meet the needs of parenthood was important to enhance engagement, such as offering program sessions on different days and at different times to accommodate the baby&#x02019;s routine and parents returning to work. Engagement was also enhanced when the program content and delivery style created an opportunity for group discussions and strengthened social connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00509-f001">Figure 1</xref>). </p><p>A detailed overview of these themes, and the enablers and barriers to engagement within each theme, is provided below and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-10-00509-t003">Table 3</xref>.

A primary enabler of attendance, common to non, low and high attendees, was &#x0201c;<italic>the need for information as a first time mother</italic>&#x0201d;.

<italic>&#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t think we&#x02019;re doing a fabulous job of reaching, perhaps, vulnerable families as well as we could be, because they&#x02019;re not necessarily the families that are going to participate in a new parents group for whatever reason &#x02026; We&#x02019;ve probably got the groups there that we could partner with, and I think that&#x02019;s been one of my really big learnings&#x02014;don&#x02019;t try and do it yourself, partner with the agencies that are already in contact with those groups, because there&#x02019;s absolutely no point in setting it up and doing it yourself&#x0201d; </italic>

It is suggested that while the use of technology (internet websites, forums and apps) to access health information by parents is ubiquitous, mothers with higher levels of education are still likely to use &#x02018;authoritative online sources&#x02019;, and mothers with lower levels of education are more likely to use discussion forums and social media [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Being comfortable using technology is an important factor in determining the use of online resources by parents [<xref rid="B59-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and given the multitasking nature of parenthood, online resources must be easily accessible and readily understood [<xref rid="B58-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. </p><p>Organisational factors affecting parental engagement included <italic>program promotion and referral; recruitment</italic>; <italic>enrolment, scheduling and access</italic>. Promotion and referral through the maternal and child health service via routine &#x02018;Key Ages and Stages&#x02019; consultations was regarded as an efficient mechanism, given the high uptake of this service and frequency of contact. Broader program promotion, especially prior to the birth of the baby, was recommended, however, to increase program awareness. A lack of program awareness, as identified in this study, is frequently cited as a practical barrier to engagement [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], often related to insufficient or ineffective advertising and resulting in reaching only those who proactively seek support [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Effective promotion is described in the literature as multi-channel (leaflets, posters, internet, local newspaper/radio stations, posted newsletters, and social media parenting forums), with clear content information that conveys the tangible benefits of the program, using text and images relevant to the target audience [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Studies also support the suggestion of program promotion prior to the birth (through ante-natal care) and early after birth (through home visits/support services/parenting groups) [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B55-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B60-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], to provide the opportunity to address potential personal barriers to engagement [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p><p>Recruitment to the <italic>Infant Program</italic> via new parent groups was considered an enabler, providing access to parents with infants of the same/similar ages and with existing social bonds. The source of program referral is described in the literature as an important contributor to the likelihood of attendance, with referrals from trusted sources [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (such as a maternal and child health nurse) positively influencing participant impressions of the relevance of a program [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Direct and personalised recruitment, via word of mouth, emails, phone calls and text message is therefore regarded as effective when delivered by people who have an established relationship with the parent [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Informal social networks are therefore encouraged as a means of extending recruitment options and positively influencing social discourse about the program topics [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Organisations were concerned, however, about how best to recruit parents who did not attend new parent groups, especially vulnerable parents, stating that organisational partnerships and adequate workforce resources were necessary to achieve this. These concerns are mirrored in other studies, with recommendations that related services work together to create strong interagency collaborations that provide multiple referral routes [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], targeted recruitment [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and cross-promotion, co-design and shared delivery of the program [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These are important considerations given the high rates of obesity among families of low socio-economic position.</p><p>The link between program attrition and the way in which participants are enrolled into programs is also of interest, especially in the context of voluntary program participation, which relies heavily on intrinsic motivation [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Study sites using an opt-out approach, where participants were enrolled in all sessions at the start, appeared to have higher patterns of attendance compared to those using an opt-in approach, which relied on the participant to self-enrol for each session. Opt-out enrolment processes have been found to be beneficial in combination with highlighting program benefits (such as enhanced knowledge, skills and social connections) [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], prompting attendance with timely reminder notifications, and ensuring that program activities are attractive to parents [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Scheduling groups with adequate numbers of parents with infants of the same/similar age was an ongoing challenge, especially for areas with low first-time parent birth rates. This limited the ability to offer a choice of session days and times, and in some cases resulted in program sessions accommodating a large age range (such as 9- and 12-month old babies). Providing a narrow range of program times has been reported to limit the attendance of parents with busy schedules [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], time constraints [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and those returning to work [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Attendance of only one parent can also place barriers on the use of program information if this information is likely to conflict with or contradict the views of the non-attending parent [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is of particular relevance given that all program participants in this study were mothers, and only one program service provider was male. The literature describes fathers as being poorly engaged by mainstream services due to the framing of parenting programs around mothers [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], program delivery usually occurring in a female-oriented environment [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and usually during working hours [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Evidence supporting the influence of fathers on the health behaviour of their young children is increasing, however, with fathers regarding themselves as playing an important role in promoting and supporting healthy eating and physical activity, and expressing a desire to have access to reliable information [<xref rid="B61-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Developing and delivering programs to accommodate parenting couples, extended family members and other carers is an important future consideration, as is the delivery of program sessions by male and female facilitators.</p><p>The program venues were described by study participants as accessible, safe and comfortable, thus enabling program attendance; with high patterns of attendance within the rural study site (62.5%). Physical access to programs is described as an important enabler in many studies, especially in rural areas where public transport may be limited or costly [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Apart from conveniently located venues that are accessible by public transport, practical considerations, such as ample parking and space for prams [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and perceptions of the safety, confidentiality and quality of the venue [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] have also been found to influence the social experience and engagement of participants. </p><p>Program factors affecting engagement encompassed the program <italic>content, format and resources</italic>; and <italic>delivery by trusted individuals</italic>. Program content focused predominantly on infant feeding and active play and therefore met the expectations of participants, however, messages perceived by participants as difficult to implement, such as screen time recommendations, were described as <italic>&#x02018;prescriptive&#x02019;</italic> and <italic>&#x02018;judgemental&#x02019;</italic>, especially by program participants with low patterns of attendance. Similar findings have been seen among low program attendees expressing fears of being judged by others or not possessing the necessary skills [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and service providers potentially evading these &#x02018;difficult&#x02019; topics for fear of disengaging parents [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The evidence suggests that group facilitators use effective communication and a supportive, non-judgemental, interactive style to involve participants and to overcome this challenge [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly within the <italic>Infant Program</italic>, participants enjoyed the inclusion of external speakers (such as dentists or first aid instructors) and peer advice (recipe ideas) to augment program information. The group-based approach was described positively by program participants and program service providers, encouraging group discussions and providing opportunities to form social contacts. Nobles and co-authors describe group size as a strong predictor of parental engagement, and found that groups of fewer than 20 participants, as opposed to one-on-one, encouraged social interaction and promoted a sense of belonging [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. </p><p>The important role played by group facilitators in creating an environment for social bonding is closely linked to the personal need of participants to share experiences and seek reassurance, often reducing feelings of isolation and normalising concerns [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The ability to form supportive relationships with participants [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], to ensure that participants feel included in the group, and to encourage the mutual sharing and positive reinforcement that builds confidence and parental self-efficacy, are viewed as important group facilitator qualities to prevent program attrition [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], in addition to the necessary training and expertise [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] regarding program content. Apart from professional skills, this study found a preference by program participants for group facilitators with personal experience in caring for infants; a finding supported by Koerting and co-authors [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. </p><p>Across the study sites, the provision of experienced professionals to facilitate groups was a challenge when workforce capacity was stretched by existing clinical workloads. The integration of program implementation as routine practice, thereby attracting organisational resourcing, was described by one study site as a means of addressing workforce capacity. Studies note that the turnover of staff is likely to affect relationship-building and impact program attendance, suggesting the continuity of group facilitators throughout program delivery [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. </p><p>These findings align with those identified by others, where parental engagement was enhanced when the program met the expectations and needs of the participants [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the program content had clear objectives and was underpinned by a strong theoretical base, and program delivery was flexible, in order to accommodate busy and hard-to-reach parents [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-10-00509"><title>5. Study Implications</title><p>The study findings provide insights into the factors influencing parental engagement in an early childhood obesity prevention program, and therefore also highlight the changes needed to address modifiable barriers to engagement. While numerous studies focus on the influence of personal factors on parental engagement, there is growing acknowledgement that the majority of modifiable factors are likely to be found within the program and/or its implementation [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nutrients-10-00509" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A key strength of this study is the review of the whole engagement process, from program promotion, referral and enrolment, to implementation and attendance. The study is strengthened further by the inclusion of perspectives from program service providers experienced in all aspects of program implementation across three diverse geographic locations. Although the characteristics of the interviewees were comparable with those of the total sample of survey respondents, this study only interviewed English-speaking, female parents, and had a low overall response rate (10.6%). The study findings may therefore not be representative of all program participants and should be extrapolated with caution. The enablers and barriers identified in this study are similar to those in the literature, however, and therefore could be considered to have broader relevance and transferability to similar programs.</p><p>As is usual for qualitative studies, the sample size and diversity were challenged by the fact that the responding individuals were likely to be more motivated and to have been more engaged in the program, and that not all participants who expressed interest were interviewed as they were uncontactable or declined. Stratification by program attendance assisted the inclusion of multiple perspectives from non, low and high program attendees. While numbers were small, the inclusion of non-attendees also provided insights into attendance decisions for this typically under-reported cohort. </p></sec><sec id="sec7-nutrients-10-00509"><title>7. Conclusions</title><p>The transition to parenthood is associated with a period of heightened receptiveness to information and guidance, especially in relation to infant feeding. This transition is also associated with the need for social connections and shared experiences with other parents. A group-based program delivered during the first year of parenthood providing reliable, age-appropriate messages on relevant topics such as feeding, active play, sleep and safety, such as the <italic>Infant Program</italic>, appears to meet this need. Maternal and child health nurses who have an established relationship with parents through routine and regular contact, provide a trusted point of referral to the program, and are in a position to positively influence attitudes to program enrolment from the first home visit after birth. Adaptations to program delivery may be necessary to extend recruitment beyond new parent groups in order to reach more vulnerable parents, where groups are more likely to have infants of mixed ages, and parents from multicultural backgrounds. </p><p>The factors influencing parental engagement in the <italic>Infant Program</italic> highlight a number of personal, organisational and program barriers and enablers that are interconnected around the adjustment to parenthood and the need for knowledge, reassurances, and social connections. Identifying and understanding these factors is important so that appropriate strategies can be developed to enhance parental engagement and participation in &#x02018;early years&#x02019; interventions.</p><p>The study findings provide important insights into the decision-making processes of new parents adjusting to parenthood and factors influencing program attendance. An exploration of the enablers and barriers experienced by program service providers advances our understanding of the implementation context and ability to support parental engagement.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by the NHMRC, as part of the Centre of Research Excellence in the Early Prevention of Obesity in Childhood (EPOCH).</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-nutrients-10-00509"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following is available online at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/4/509/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/4/509/s1</uri>.
